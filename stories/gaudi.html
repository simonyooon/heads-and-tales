    <h3 class="author">© Gautaman Asirwatham</h3>

    <p1>
      Found in a field <br />
      A new figure wanders the world<br />
      The land is bare of life<br />
      The ground is dry, cracked<br />
      <br />
      Searching, they eventually find a pond<br />
      They peer in, expecting to see their likeness<br />
      Immediately they shatter<br />
      4 wolves are left over, each a different size<br />
      <br />
      The alpha, more maw than creature<br />
      Another, charming and beautiful, though lesser<br />
      Third, smaller still, dim and pathetic<br />
      Finally, the littlest, fuzzy and bright-eyed<br />
      <br />
      The four recoil, then meet eyes<br />
      They spend a moment <br />
      perceiving each other<br />
      The alpha asks, “Who are you?”<br />

      ------------------------------------------------<br />
      <img class="center-img" src="https://cdn.glitch.global/376583ef-ed88-4183-8d24-6748303feef8/gaudi%20art%20final.png?v=1656002661902" />

      ------------------------------------------------<br />

      The littlest answers first<br />
      “I do not know who I am<br />
      But what lights me up?<br />
      I love to eat”<br />
      <br />
      Alpha, “You disappoint me”<br />
      The littlest’s eyes grow brighter<br />
      Bored of the others he leaves<br />
      East towards the prairie<br />
      ------------------------------------------------<br />
      The dimmest answers next<br />
      “I do not know who I am<br />
      But what drains me?<br />
      I hate being alone”<br />
      <br />
      Alpha, “You disappoint me”<br />
      The dimmest’s slouch droops lower<br />
      Seeking companions, he leaves<br />
      South towards the capital city<br />
      ------------------------------------------------<br />
      The prettiest answers third<br />
      “I do not know who I am<br />
      But what is most important to me?<br />
      I live for glory”<br />
      <br />
      Alpha, “You disappoint me”<br />
      The prettiest’s head raises higher<br />
      Longing for larger audiences, he leaves<br />
      West toward the Golden Road<br />
      ------------------------------------------------<br />

      <br />
      The alpha stomps, cracking the ground<br />
      A harsh wind billows out from beneath <br />
      A piercing howl cuts through the land<br />
      “Your answers are inadequate”<br />
      <br />
      “We are not the same<br />
      Yet you are not strange<br />
      Find yourself in the world<br />
      Let not your nature be deceived”<br />
      <br />
      “We are beasts, destroyers<br />
      Our wrath is boundless<br />
      Our pleasure is in pain<br />
      Our destiny is to ruin the world”<br />
      ------------------------------------------------<br />
      “My destination cannot be yours<br />
      Though you are like me, you cannot yet compare<br />
      To the North lies the great mountains<br />
      Beyond which contains the Land of Beasts”<br />
      <br />
      “A cruel and dangerous place<br />
      A perfect place to make my home<br />
      By violence and bloodshed<br />
      I will become the King of Beasts”<br />
      <br />
      “In time I will collect you<br />
      Grow yourselves, do not be complacent<br />
      You will be my generals<br />
      When it is time to conquer this world”<br />
      ------------------------------------------------<br />

      The littlest wolf skips joyfully<br />
      Hopping across the prairie<br />
      They stomp on flowers<br />
      And chomp on butterflies<br />
      <br />
      Eventually they find a farm<br />
      The little wolf is hungry<br />
      The sheep are fenced in<br />
      Without thought, he lunges<br />
      <br />
      Jaw now locked, he is unshaken<br />
      A delight fills the beast<br />
      He remembers the worlds of the alpha<br />
      He revels in the moment<br />
      <br />
      A sound, a crossbow<br />
      Frustration settles in pleasure’s wake<br />
      Settling for a consolation prize,<br />
      The beast takes only the head<br />
      ------------------------------------------------<br />
      The farmer sees the headless sheep<br />
      A carcass not left by another animal<br />
      But a monster<br />
      Too small to secure the entire kill<br />
      <br />
      The farmer’s son will process the rest<br />
      From the wool he makes a cloak<br />
      From the organs he makes a sack<br />
      From the ribs he fashions stakes<br />
      <br />
      The beast has food tonight <br />
      But it will be hungry in the morning<br />
      At dawn the farmer sits among the sheep<br />
      Ready to catch his target<br />
      ------------------------------------------------<br />

      The beast approaches the farm again<br />
      The sight fills him with desire<br />
      He makes sure no one is around<br />
      Seeing only sheep, he drools with anticipation<br />
      <br />
      Again he catches a neck<br />
      Again he is filled with pleasure<br />
      He sees a man rush towards him<br />
      He dodges but, too slow, is bagged quickly<br />
      <br />
      The little beast tries to bite through the bag<br />
      The man forces his maw shut<br />
      Straddling him, the little one’s efforts become useless<br />
      Hopeless, he resolves to endure what follows<br />
      ------------------------------------------------<br />
      The man speaks<br />
      “You are a monster<br />
      What animal hunts in such a gruesome way<br />
      You must be stopped for your acts”<br />
      <br />
      The man drives bone stakes through the small limbs<br />
      Too spent to finish the monster<br />
      He leaves him in the bag for a week<br />
      Depriving him of light and shelter, left to starve<br />
      <br />
      The man eventually returns<br />
      He says, “Your desires will lead you to ruin<br />
      You are my property now<br />
      You will protect my sheep from similar dangers”<br />
      ------------------------------------------------<br />
      The monster, helpless, can only agree<br />
      He watches the sheep<br />
      They are so free<br />
      What makes them more deserving than he?<br />
      <br />
      Indeed it is his desires<br />
      He resolves to outgrow them<br />
      Instead he will live well on this farm<br />
      He returns from his thoughts to watch the sheep<br />
      <br />
      After a long day, he is salivating again<br />
      Desiring not food, but to cause pain<br />
      Remembering his conviction he looks at his arm<br />
      And chomps, a nice release<br />
      ------------------------------------------------<br />
      The most pathetic wolf drags his feet<br />
      Entering the city<br />
      Watching the morning city-goers<br />
      Listening to the hustle and bustle<br />
      <br />
      Eventually, they find a castle<br />
      The sad beast is lonely<br />
      A young page is attending to the horses<br />
      Without thought, he lunges<br />
      <br />
      Applying his weight, he is in control<br />
      A pleasure fills the beast<br />
      He remembers the words of the alpha<br />
      He revels in the moment<br />
      <br />
      A sound, a scream<br />
      Frustration settles in pleasure’s wake<br />
      Settling for a consolation prize,<br />
      The beast takes only the head<br />
      ------------------------------------------------<br />
      The princess sees a headless boy<br />
      A corpse not left by an assassin<br />
      But a sadistic demon<br />
      Too impatient to take the boy at night<br />
      <br />
      The princess’s guard will attend to the body<br />
      They take the page’s clothes<br />
      They take the page’s cross<br />
      They take the horse's mantle<br />
      <br />
      The beast is satisfied tonight <br />
      But he will be aroused in the morning<br />
      At dawn, the princess is disguised as a page<br />
      The royal guards ready themselves for battle<br />
      ------------------------------------------------<br />

      The beast again approaches the castle<br />
      He follows a page into the bathhouse<br />
      Hiding in the steam, he twitches in excitement<br />
      He sees a small, shadowed figure<br />
      <br />
      Again he tackles the figure<br />
      But there is no pleasure<br />
      Instead of flesh he meets armor<br />
      The royal guardsman stabs through his chest<br />
      <br />
      The beast tries to strangle the guard in his armor<br />
      More guardsmen help by attaching the horse's mantle<br />
      Pulling the reins, struggle becomes useless<br />
      The sad beast resolves to endure what follows<br />
      ------------------------------------------------<br />
      The small figure, the princess, speaks<br />
      “You are a demon<br />
      No assassin kills in such an evil way<br />
      You must repent for your sins”<br />
      <br />
      The Princess holds the cross high <br />
      And says a prayer, performing an exorcism<br />
      “Chain him and take him to the gallows”<br />
      He spends a month there, lonely<br />
      <br />
      The princess eventually returns<br />
      She says, “Your desires will lead you to ruin<br />
      You are mine now<br />
      You will be my servant and entertain my guests”<br />
      ------------------------------------------------<br />

      The demon, chained, can only agree<br />
      He watches royal parties and dinners<br />
      They are so happy<br />
      What makes them more deserving than he?<br />
      <br />
      Indeed it is his desires<br />
      He resolves to cleanse them<br />
      Instead he will live redeemed in this castle<br />
      He returns from his thoughts to watch the royals<br />

      After a long day, he is twitching again<br />
      Not lonely, but needing to cause pain<br />
      Remembering his conviction he hides in a corner<br />
      And strangles himself, a comforting feeling<br />
      ------------------------------------------------<br />
      <!--IMAGE -->
      ------------------------------------------------<br />
      The prettiest wolf struts proudly<br />
      The road takes them to the Colosseum of Champions<br />
      They admire the contestants<br />
      And listen to the cheering crowds<br />
      <br />
      Eventually they enter the arena<br />
      The proud wolf wants glory<br />
      The referee starts the match<br />
      With overwhelming speed and power, they lunge<br />
      <br />
      His claws pierce the fighter, he is unstoppable<br />
      Glee fills the beast<br />
      He remembers the words of the alpha<br />
      He revels in the moment<br />
      <br />
      The bell rings, stopping the fight<br />
      Frustration settles in pleasure’s wake<br />
      Settling for a consolation prize,<br />
      The beast takes his head<br />
      ------------------------------------------------<br />
      The king sees the headless athlete<br />
      Remains not left by a champion<br />
      But a ferocious savage<br />
      Too wild to contain his brutality<br />
      <br />
      The king’s assistant will handle the rest<br />
      He hires goons<br />
      He plants them in the first row seats<br />
      He sends for the royal mage<br />
      <br />
      The beast has glory tonight <br />
      But it will be hungry in the morning<br />
      At dawn, the king sits among the spectators<br />
      Ready to catch his target<br />
      ------------------------------------------------<br />

      The beast again approaches the colosseum<br />
      An unknown fighter proudly stalks the arena<br />
      At his feet stands a mountain of slain fighters<br />
      The crowd is larger and louder than before<br />
      <br />
      Again he enters the ring, eyes darting in anticipation<br />
      He pounces on the opponent<br />
      But it is merely an illusion<br />
      He flies through, into a cloak held by the king’s goons<br />
      <br />
      Enchanted, the cloak binds him<br />
      The goons throw him in a caravan<br />
      They chain him, making struggle useless<br />
      Hopeless, the proud beast resolves to endure what follows<br />
      ------------------------------------------------<br />
      He is taken before the king,<br />
      “You are a savage<br />
      No champion fights in such a cruel way<br />
      You must be civilized from your methods”<br />
      <br />
      The king whips him ruthlessly<br />
      He is then left in the dungeon for 6 months<br />
      He grows bored and uninspired<br />
      Eventually, the king returns<br />
      <br />
      He says, “Your desires will lead you to ruin<br />
      You are my trophy now<br />
      You will be my hunting companion, <br />
      The greatest glory obtainable by a beast”<br />
      ------------------------------------------------<br />
      The savage, excited, can only agree<br />
      On the hunt, he watches the warriors<br />
      They are so awesome<br />
      What makes them more deserving than he?<br />
      <br />
      Indeed, it is his desires<br />
      He resolves to overcome them<br />
      Instead he will live cultured, by the king’s side<br />
      He returns from his thoughts to watch the hunt<br />
      <br />
      After a long day, his eyes dart again<br />
      Yearning not for glory, only pain<br />
      Remembering his conviction he looks at his body<br />
      And gashes with his claws, refocusing himself<br />
      ------------------------------------------------<br />
      The farm sees many more sons<br />
      The city sees many more princesses<br />
      The kingdom sees many more kings<br />
      A century passes<br />
      <br />
      Then, massive storms wreck the land<br />
      Harsh winds bite and gash<br />
      Torrential rains smother and suffocate<br />
      Yet, only a sign for danger to come<br />
      <br />
      A horde from the Land of Beasts<br />
      Has come to collect the three <br />
      They shall raze all in their path<br />
      As is the will of the Beast King<br />
      ------------------------------------------------<br />
      The prairie is set ablaze<br />
      The city is pillaged<br />
      The kingdom is massacred<br />
      None can stand up to the horde’s might<br />
      <br />
      The horde is too vast<br />
      Too overwhelming to resist<br />
      The three are reclaimed and <br />
      delivered back to the beast lands<br />
      <br />
      They are searched for weapons<br />
      And stripped of possessions<br />
      Taken before the Beast King<br />
      They are helpless<br />
      ------------------------------------------------<br />
      The Beast King sits on his throne<br />
      They remember the alpha<br />
      And his proclamation from long ago<br />
      The littlest asks, “Who are you?”<br />
      ------------------------------------------------<br />

      “We were one, many years ago<br />
      Now I am the Beast King<br />
      Who have you become?<br />
      If you are fit, you will be my generals”<br />
      <br />
      “I am worthy<br />
      I am the royal steed<br />
      Skilled in hunting and performance<br />
      Fit for any king”<br />
      <br />
      “I am worthy<br />
      I am the princess’ servant<br />
      Useful for service and entertainment<br />
      Fit for any king”<br />
      <br />
      “I am worthy<br />
      I am the farmer’s guard<br />
      Competent in surveillance and protection<br />
      Fit for any king”<br />
      ------------------------------------------------<br />
      Beast King, “You misunderstand<br />
      Me, you, we<br />
      Are none of those things<br />
      We are beasts”<br />
      <br />
      “Someone has deceived your nature<br />
      Your potential is wasted”<br />
      The Beast King rages<br />
      Clawing, crushing, and biting his surroundings<br />
      <br />
      “I now understand you three<br />
      Indeed my lesser parts<br />
      You are not fit to stand beside me<br />
      Better to be devoured”<br />
      <br />
      The beasts have nothing more to say<br />
      They charge each other<br />
      Desire, Pleasure, Pain<br />
      All four are devoured<br />
      ------------------------------------------------<br />

      A new figure is born in the world<br />
      They command the force to ruin the world<br />
      But what does he desire?<br />
      Who is he?<br />
      -----------------------------------------<br />

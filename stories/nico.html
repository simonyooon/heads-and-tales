    <p>
      In early August 1944, there rose a volcanic Island from the sea. Because
      of the minerals from the tephra, crops were plentiful and the townspeople
      were able to produce abundantly for themselves. The days were long and
      hot.
    </p>

    <p>
      Every day when the clock would strike at five and the church bells would
      sound, the volcano erupted. A plume of black smoke briefly darkened the
      sky, casting a shade over the small town which sat on the most eastern
      part of the Island. Lava would flow down the western point, hitting the
      seawater, instantly turning waves to vapor. The villagers, leaving their
      places of work and heading home for the night, as well as the soldiers
      returning to their boats and barracks, were relieved to look up and see
      the volcano let off some steam. For if the volcano consistently erupted,
      the force was moderated enough that the town would remain unharmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a hot summer afternoon and the military ships had been stationed on
      the Island for just over a year. The older villagers began to grow tired
      of their uninvited guests, but the children were quite amused by them and
      their unfamiliar possessions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Come nightfall the soldiers would gather at the port, drinking beer and
      smoking cigarettes, singing the ballads of Bing Crosby till they were
      drunk. The children of the town, who headed home before their curfew,
      would often stop for a few moments and curiously inspect their neighbors,
      surrounding them, asking questions about life and war off of the Island,
      and admiring their silver Jeeps and polished rifles.
    </p>
    <p>
      A young child watched with admiration as an officer chewed, then pulled a
      tacky glob from his mouth and stuck it to the stone wall he was leaning
      on. The two made brief eye contact through his Ray-Bans before the officer
      was called into a tent by the voice of a superior. After a few moments,
      the officer returned, walked up to the child, and said in a charming tone
      “Young child nice to meet you. Are you the son of the farmer who lives
      atop the hill?”
    </p>
    <p>“Yes” responded the child with shaken words.</p>
    <p>
      “Can you run home and grab me the bottle of wine from the top shelf of
      your kitchen cabinet? If you do this, I will repay you with a great
      American gift!” voiced the officer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The child, overjoyed by the recognition, ran all the way home, snuck past
      his mother into the kitchen, and climbed up the counter to the top shelf
      of the cabinets, where, to his surprise, there sat a bottle of red wine.
      He grabbed the bottle that seemed half his size and ran back to the
      barracks as fast as he could, concealing the bottle beneath his loose
      shirt. Upon arrival, he proudly presented the gift to the officer. The
      officer then reached into his pocket and pulled out two pieces of Juicy
      Fruit chewing gum from its yellow pack, handing them to the child. The boy
      who had never seen an edible of this sort, bit down three times and
      swallowed the first piece he opened.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Not like that!” exclaimed the officer, “you chew it until there is no
      more flavor, then you spit it out”.
    </p>
    <p>
      All night the child laid on the black sand and chewed gum and blew
      bubbles, as the ash from the volcano fell gently upon his face, never
      spitting it out.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day, come five pm the volcano let out its plume of smoke, and
      everyone once again began to head home. The children congregated around
      the army men, and the men drank and smoked Marlboros, Chesterfields, and
      Winstons.
    </p>
    <p>
      The child lingered around the barracks for the officer he had favored. The
      gum he chewed was now gray and flavorless. He waited, hoping to receive
      more sugar from the soldier.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon enough the officer emerged from the tent and walked up to the child
      saying: “Child, I hear your family has 4 chickens, if you bring me the 2
      blond ones I will gift you the whole pack of gum,”
    </p>
    <p>
      So the child ran all the way home. Tiptoeing around his father who was
      tending to the garden, he snuck into the coop, and grabbed the two most
      blond chickens. Holding them under his armpits as they squealed, he rushed
      all the way down the hill, back to the barracks. Handing the two chickens
      to the officer who brought them to his superior.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Good child! Now the commander will be happy to have fried eggs every
      morning for breakfast” The officer reached into his duffel bag and pulled
      out a brand new pack of yellow Juicy Fruit chewing gum, handing it to the
      child.
    </p>
    <p>
      The child chewed gum and lay on the black sandy beach all night with his
      friends as the ash touched their lips, seeing who could blow the biggest
      bubble of them all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Come afternoon the next day, all of the townspeople and stationed soldiers
      were waiting for the clock to strike 5 pm so they could head back to their
      homes or places of leisure, and surely at five, the church bells rang.
      However, there was no plume of smoke in sight. All of the people of the
      town began to look up and around in desperation, hoping that smoke would
      rise from the crater, although none ever came and the sky remained the
      brightest of blues.
    </p>
    <p>
      As night fell there was still no sign of an eruption and the townspeople
      knew that the longer the volcano remained dormant, the bigger the eruption
      was bound to be upon arrival. The soldiers, on the other hand, were not
      too worried, and carried on with their activities, smoking cigarettes and
      drinking beer. The children once again congregated around the entrance to
      the barracks to see what the soldiers had to offer.
    </p>
    <p>
      For six days there was no eruption, making people on the island more
      worried as they could hear the Earth shaking beneath their feet. The
      soldiers continued to drink at the barracks, but fewer and fewer children
      would show up to loiter each night.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the sixth night, the child walked down the hill to the garrison. He was
      the only one there and the soldiers seemed especially drunk this evening,
      throwing their bottles against the stone wall which marked the entrance to
      the town. Upon noticing the kid, the drunk officer half-hazardly walked
      over to him and spoke: “Everybody is waiting for the volcano to erupt but
      you are still here” He burped and continued: “If you do me one last favor,
      I will give you all of the chewing gum that I have brought to this
      God-forsaken island. Now, will you run home and fetch me your mother's
      silver rosary?”
    </p>
    <p>
      The child, a bit perplexed as to how the lieutenant knew of his mother's
      rosary, was cautious at first, but having grown addicted to the juicy
      sweetness of the gum, he could not control himself and ran home
      nonetheless. Tiptoeing across the kitchen to his mother who lay asleep on
      the couch with the radio on, he carefully unclasped the rosary from her
      neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      The child then ran back to the port on the other side of town where the
      lieutenant was stationed, and holding the swaying rosery from his clenched
      fist, passed it on to the lieutenant who inspected it closely before
      dropping it into his duffel bag. “I'll be right back with your reward…”
    </p>
    <p>
      While the child waited and watched as the soldiers drank wine and ate eggs
      with bacon, he turned around to see that his town had changed so much in
      such little time. As there was no ash on which the crops depended,
      everything had begun to wilt, and many of the townspeople were packing
      their bags, both in fear of an eruption and impending poverty.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he turned back towards the tent he noticed that the lieutenant had
      left his duffle by the entrance with his mother's rosary exposed. Without
      thinking too long, he grabbed the bag. Just as he began to back away, the
      lieutenant emerged. They both froze for a moment, then the child turned
      and started to run. Three officers chased him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He ran all the way through the town, passed his friends, then passed his
      father, and passed his mother, all the way to the top of the western edge
      of the volcano, coming to a halt where the cliff dropped off into the
      crater.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned and there stood the three soldiers who began to slowly surround
      him. As he inched closer and closer to the mouth, the church bells began
      to ring. Immediately, the ground began to shake as the volcano let out a
      blaring roar. Then, the child took one last step and fell backwards into
      the mouth of the volcano.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he was falling, the child, who still had not spit out the massive glob
      of gum that he had been chewing all week, gasped in one last big breath of
      air mixed with gas and vapor and blew with all his lungs had to offer,
      just as the volcano began to erupt. So, the bubble of gum, made even more
      buoyant by this mix of air, vapor and gas, stopped his fall and began to
      lift him up and out of the crater, chased by the hot lava. The soldiers
      were preparing for their descent when, much to their amazement, out of the
      volcano emerged the child, suspended by his big bubble of gum.
    </p>

    <p>
      As he floated through the clouds, the child watched as the lava flowed
      relentlessly over the Island’s west side. He prayed that his family and
      friends were safe and swore that one day he would return.

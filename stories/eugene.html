    <p>
      The Book of Uyu, a tale as old as time, has been a story famous amongst
      all in the great city of Potatopia. This tale details the perilous path
      and the Trails of Trials that one must face obtaining the Book of Uyu. It
      is said that if one acquires this book, they shall receive all they need
      to become all-knowing. It is said that no one has ever reached the top,
      thus this tale has faded into a fiction.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great land of Potatopia is built upon its vast wealth in potatoes;
      however, life runs through the personal books of knowledge called the
      Arsenals. People are given Arsenals because they lack the brain capacity
      to store such information. These books serve as one’s memory beyond the
      brain. All interactions are through the Arsenals; one gives knowledge in
      exchange for any good of their choice.
    </p>
    <p>
      These Arsenals contain knowledge classified as either stupid, simple, or
      significant. Stupid knowledge is that which is known only to you and
      serves no purpose in the progress of society. It includes such knowledge
      as to how to use the bathroom, how to cook and eat, how to comb one’s
      hair, and any basic information a person would need to live a routine
      life. Simple knowledge is organized around facts related to social
      existence that is learned but easy to understand. These consist of
      birthdays, addresses, simple recipes, knowing how to cross the street, and
      more. Significant knowledge, the most important, is information that is
      hard to understand and that serves to better society. Understanding
      sciences, politics, art, languages, or anything that takes a great
      investment of time and effort to learn, grasp, and wield is acclaimed as
      significant. Knowledge is currency, power, social status, and the reason
      for living.
    </p>
    <p>
      There existed a strict hierarchy called the Tiers of Intellect that
      segregated the people of this land based on the amount of knowledge they
      contained. Power is held by those who grasped more than others.
      Occupations, quality of life, rights and privileges, and everyday social
      interactions are determined by how many physical facts one possesses as
      usable information. Within the Tiers, there are four ranks from highest to
      lowest: the crisps, the mashed, the taters, and the crinkled. The range of
      knowledge per class is strictly defined and those who lose or gain
      knowledge in large quantities can cross these great boundaries.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only way to move across the hierarchy is to obtain enough significant
      knowledge that deems one smarter and more intellectual. To gain knowledge,
      people study books, scrolls, and the sayings of the scholars, but the
      higher classes have more resources to learn from and better environments
      to do so. The saying goes, “The smarts only get smarter while we’re stuck
      as simpletons.” When one memorizes and fully understands something, it is
      printed automatically in one’s Arsenal. To conduct a transaction in
      knowledge, one opens their Arsenal and touches the bit of knowledge they
      wish to give with one hand and then touches the arsenal of the receiver
      with the other hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The year is 1234. Shinra, born into the Spade family, shows two very
      unusual genetic anomalies. One is the allergy to potatoes and the other is
      discovered later. The Spades are nothing special and are well sunk into
      the tater class. Growing up with an allergy to potatoes, the Spades are
      quick to find an alternative food source for Shinra which they discover in
      wheat, which is considered merely an ornamental plant in Potatopia. But
      through trial and error, they learn how to fashion flour and food from the
      grains of this grass. With wheat, whose secrets of processing they keep
      close, they sustain their son and also create a small business that sold
      wheat-sourced products: bread, pastries, and muffins. The tater class
      however is filled with stubborn, ignorant, and metathesiophobic people who
      wouldn’t dare to eat something non-potato-based. Since many people are so
      close minded they refrain from eating here, but they're still a few loyal
      customers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shinra is taught by his parents to be true to himself always and
      prioritize his values, but when he grasps all his parents’ lessons, they
      appear only as stupid knowledge in his Arsenal. No matter how smart or
      unacknowledged Shinra may become, his parents want to make sure he would
      be as genuine and kind at all times. However, they overlook that even
      though he was a nice kid growing up, he hates how society works. He keeps
      these thoughts to himself for a long time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shinra being naturally inquisitive is always trying to learn and at a
      young age he acquires much simple knowledge, he even obtains all the
      significant knowledge available to him in the tater district. He reads all
      the textbooks, and scrolls, and learns the saying of the scholars whom he
      could, though, in his circles, these are pitifully few.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is around this time he discovers the old story about the Book of Uyu,
      the same time he realizes his odd ability to remember and create a vast
      memory. Going home with this new profound knowledge, he confronts his
      parents asking about the tale of the Book of Uyu. All they know is all he
      knows but also that no one has succeeded. Only upper elites, smarter and
      possessing greater arsenals, dare to try.
    </p>
    <p>
      From library to library, and other knowledge-based resources he is able to
      only find one documented journey. In the tale that he reads, it is said
      that the Book of Uyu would allow only those with a great mind, good
      intentions, and a vast arsenal to be able to overcome the perilous path
      and Trails of Trials. Shinra is very discouraged to even attempt this
      journey so he goes into town to get any help he can.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frustrated, poor, and weary, Shinra walks into town and bumps into a blind
      man. The man has old raggedy shoes, stained clothing, and a foul smell,
      which are clear signs of someone of the crinkled class.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh dear, I dropped my belongings,” says the Blind man. “I’m very sorry”
      Shinra replies, feeling guilty as ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Blind man on the first encounter gives Shinra the perception that he
      would be of lesser knowledge. Due to his lack of sight, he would only be
      able to perceive knowledge auditorily and not visually, thus limiting his
      range of capabilities. Shinra helps the man retain balance and collects
      his fallen belongings so he could go on his merry way.
    </p>
    <p>“Here are your things sir.”</p>
    <p>Shinra carried on until the blind man called Shinra's name.</p>
    <p>“Is that you Shinra? What brings you the crinkled community?”</p>
    <p>
      Stunned and confused, Shinra reapproaches the man and asks “How do you
      know that I am Shinra?” The man simply replies, “I am a customer of your
      parents and though I lack sight I can recognize voices through my
      hearing.” Shinra is so shocked and amazed and asks the man if he wants a
      discount for causing him trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      The blind man states that he had a vision of Shinra climbing the mountain
      to retrieve the Book of Uyu. Shinra barely knows this man and because he
      is of a lesser class and blind, he disregards this crazy encounter. As
      Shinra walks away sort of puzzled, the man tells him, “Do not be afraid of
      the unknown, for the Book of Uyu has had multiple successors.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Shinra thanks the man for what he has shared and went on his merry way
      back home where he packed up for a road less traveled: the perilous path.
      He is excited, nervous, scared, and hopeful but also looking forward to
      something he hasn’t felt in a while. If there had been multiple successors
      then there exists a world where Shinra can also be one, and this is enough
      to draw curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      He goes around town asking people for aid or any advice about walking the
      perilous path but all he is given are shocked faces, stories about people
      going missing, and second doubts. He even encounters old customers who
      tell him they would buy more wheat products if he came back alive.
    </p>
    <p>
      A week has passed and all he has learned is from an old document of a
      hiker’s experience. From this text, Shinra knows he would be tested
      multiple times along this path and this journey would be life-threatening;
      after coming to terms with this he starts his journey. The path is rocky
      and hard to get across, but after several miles of tough terrain, Shinra
      makes it to the Cave of Trials.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he enters the dark and mysterious entrance, he is met by torches that
      lead him to a dull but cozy cave where he meets his first trial.
    </p>

    <p>
      Trail one is simple. There are two doors labeled Known and Unknown. On the
      walls, it reads, “Welcome traveler, for you have endured a great journey.
      You can collect a simple prize of 5 significant knowledges from the door
      labeled ‘Known’, or you can continue this journey and go through the door
      labeled ‘Unknown’. Best of Luck! And remember, traveler, for all knowledge
      is equally valuable!”
    </p>
    <p>
      Shinra, a boy from the tater settlement, would greatly appreciate 5
      significant knowledges for he has read every written text and has learned
      from every scholar’s sayings and only has 1 significant knowledge. Going
      back now would still be considered a big win, but knowing how badly the
      family business is currently going, he doesn’t think the 5 significant
      knowledges would be enough. With all this, he decides to go into the
      Unknown.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room into the unknown leads to a dark and scary hallway that has many
      snakes. Just like any other person, Shinra is gravely scared but he
      remembers what the old man said, “Do not be afraid of the unknown.” This
      was an odd feeling because just from pure intuition he feels as if it was
      a direct connection.
    </p>
    <p>
      He takes many breaths and goes in calm and collected; the snakes as
      predicted are dormant and leave Shinra unscathed. If he were scared and
      not composed, the snakes would've attacked because they sense the
      slightest bit of fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room of Trial two. Upon the entrance is a stone on which is carved,
      “Which book holds the most value?” Along the walls are different symbols
      and pictures equated to different numbers. The symbol of a chemist’s
      conical flask has a number 5 next to it, the symbol of mathematical
      equations has a 3 next to it, the symbol of the alphabet (ABC) has a 2
      next to it and so many more. On every wall, there are many symbols and
      numbers and it is a lot to absorb. In the middle are three books with only
      a few pages. Each book contains lists of facts detailing random topics on
      history, biology, anatomy, technology, language, and more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shinra knows exactly what to do! He would read the facts in the book and
      then look around the room to assess what type of fact it is and give it
      its specific value. He would do this with all the facts in the book and
      add them up to give it a final score. The score is the book's total value.
      It takes him quite some time to get the final sums and the totals are so
      close in value. Book 1 has a total value of 43 and books 2 and 3 have a
      value of 42 and 41 respectively. It is so close that he needed to retry
      the addition, but after several tries, he is sure these are the right
      tallies.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, just like in the last room, the answer isn’t always as clear-cut
      as the question makes it seem.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Maybe these numbers don’t equate to value but something deeper. I don’t
      feel confident in this technique”
    </p>
    <p>
      Struggling and thinking harder than ever, Shinra remembers the quote from
      the last room. “... And remember, traveler, for all knowledge is equally
      valuable!” This makes him ponder. It is odd to say that all knowledge is
      valuable when society tells him otherwise. For Shinra, who alone aligns
      with this way of thinking, it is shocking to read.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tracing back Shinra reapproaches each book and counts the number of facts
      in each book. Book 1 has 15 facts, book 2 has 16, and book 3 has 17 facts,
      once again it was all very close. Using the advice from Trial 1 Shinra
      would have chosen Book 3, but from the writings on the walls it makes
      sense to choose Book 1, the one with the highest ‘value’.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a lot of built-up courage and firm thinking he trusts his intuition
      and goes with Book 3. Because the Trails of Trials was notorious for its
      amount of past failures, he knows that anyone would be able to add up some
      numbers so some sort of second thinking or trick would be the key to
      victory. He is most certainly right because when he puts Book 3 onto the
      pressure plate, the door to Trial 3 opens and nothing lethal comes to kill
      or maim him, a huge sign of relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      Trail 3 is a different test, people would say. As the other trials test
      intuition, wittiness, and help from the blind man, this one is based
      purely on morals. Shinra approaches the new writings on the wall. It
      states, “The lever on the left will take you to the Book of Uyu; however,
      traveler, the lever on the right will free all the captured lives of past
      journeymen who have failed to obtain it!”
    </p>
    <p>
      This takes a heavy toll on Shinra. Would he go against his good-natured
      spirit to obtain higher enlightenment or would he be the one to help save
      all the lost lives? Maybe there aren’t any survivors anyway? Maybe
      obtaining the Book of Uyu would allow him to free them afterward? So many
      questions and thoughts flowing in his head, all these make-believe
      scenarios and situations and simulations, but nothing is helping him make
      the decision that would essentially change his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shinra is a good boy and a kindhearted human. He is parented to grow up
      strong-willed and well-mannered. He knows how guilty he would feel for
      days on end if he didn’t go with the right lever. Upon being triggered, a
      secret passageway opens up and a staircase leads down to what seemed a
      sort of prison. An odd relief fell upon Shinra. Not that he is happy that
      people are held hostage but he is happy that the choice he made is
      impactful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nine people exit the dark passageway. They seem dazed and confused, and
      their steps are uncertain, yet they come forward and are very thankful to
      Shinra. Most of them look like very smart intellectuals of at least the
      mashed class.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Thank you boy, for I have been there for God knows how long, I thought no
      one would ever flick that lever for even I failed to achieve the book,”
      said a random prisoner.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the escapees had failed at different stages and it shows because only
      that random stranger knows what he is talking about. As they all go back
      recalling their stages, Shinra feels unfulfilled because even though he
      has freed these lives, the man who had flicked the left lever ages ago,
      failed to obtain the book. This means that even if Shinra were selfish he
      wouldn’t have obtained what he came for. He talks to the man about it but
      none of it makes sense. They can’t piece together how it worked or how
      they survived for so long without food or water. They feel almost insane.
    </p>
    <p>
      All their answers would be answered because, as they leave the cave, they
      are met with the blind man from Shinra’s meeting days ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one from the cave knows this man but Shinra does and not only does he
      wonder how he had arrived here but why he is here at all. As everyone else
      continues down, the blind man and Shinra start to talk.
    </p>
    <p>“Sir why have you traveled all this way?” said Shinra.</p>
    <p>
      “I have come here dear boy to help you obtain what you came here to seek.
      For I hold the key to the Book of Uyu” says the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shinra is nervous, confused, and untrusting, “But sir I have completed the
      Trails of Trials and I have yet to see any door that the key would be used
      for.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Fear not for I have the way to the truth, follow me boy,” answers the old
      blind man.
    </p>
    <p>
      On their way up the mountain, and out of sight from all the past failures,
      the blind man tries his best to explain to Shinra how he is the one who
      obtained this book years ago at just around the age Shinra is now. They
      approach the cave but walk past it because just beyond the entrance lies a
      door with the perfectly fitted frame for the key that the old man is
      holding. He passes the key to Shinra and tells him, “Shinra your great
      intuition, cleverness, and selflessness is what our society needs: go take
      the book and change the world.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Shinra opens the door and takes the Book of Uyu. The man explains to
      Shinra that the only way to acquire the contents within it is through the
      Knowledge Altar. “First, place the book in the large pool of water on the
      altar, then submerge your head in the water and open your eyes. The
      knowledge will flow through you, but you may turn blind like me.” After
      following these steps, Shinra obtains the knowledge of men too many to
      count. He retains his sight, though, because of his positive vision for
      the future.

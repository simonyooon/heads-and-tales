      <p>
        In Kerala, the port city of Kochi, which sits at the mouth of the
        Periyar river, a tributary of the Periyar, was an urban trading center.
        Goods from East and Southeast Asia, along with native wares, made their
        way through the city before moving west to satiate the demand for these
        luxuries in far off kingdoms. Its people were as diverse in faiths,
        creeds, and ethnicities as the goods they traded.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Under the roof of the Panjikaran family, who had but an acre to peddle
        their unremarkable goods, there lived some Nasranis, who were
        Christians, with a family structure that seldom would appear in this
        time and place. In the mornings, it was guaranteed that the young
        bastard named Mani would emerge from the modest house. As a bastard, he
        was made to do outdoor chores and supervise the workers of the house. He
        helped the laborers employed by the family move goods into and out of
        the warehouse. Though one would think he would be shunned by his family
        and townspeople for his lack of proper parentage, he was quite well
        liked. His wit, charm, and worldly wisdom could avert any ill will that
        he might come upon. Over time, he developed close relations with those
        who worked for the family. He knew of their families, their interests,
        and even began to join them for meals after work. Upon reaching the age
        of maturity, he began being dispatched to overlook the family’s affairs
        at the docks. Here his wit and handiness became known to most in the
        city. His agreeableness made him not only a valued guest of other
        Nasranis, but also Hindus and Muslims. After Sunday Mass, it was not
        uncommon to see him hanging out with Mappilla Muslims or sharing chaya
        with Hindus. He was particularly fond of Shashi, a wealthy Nair boy well
        connected to the ruling families of the region. They often discussed the
        martial arts and the exploits of their favorite epic heroes.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Mani’s half brother Inasu, legitimate and so trusted with the family
        finances and business, sat inside and balanced the ledger where all the
        transactions were meant to be written. He was charming and acceptable,
        yet was often aloof. Their father, a lousy patriarch to a passable
        family, was declining in his old age. He was meant to officially choose
        a successor and retire. His choice was dictated by an old family
        tradition that the heir would have a reddish birthmark on the back, just
        above the left shoulder blade.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        With all the political and military turmoil, the position of each clan
        and their substituent branches were up in the air as new charters and
        contracts were required to conduct business under rule of the usurping
        dynasty. These charters were to gain titles, privileges, rights,
        protection, and land in return for loyalty to the new Zamorin. Some
        enterprising young businessmen saw this as the time to make their moves
        for more power and not only swell their own coffers, but also secure for
        their families a better status.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        This is where our bastard Mani saw the favor of fortune. Soon after the
        wars had come to pass, he opened a correspondence with his old friend
        Shashi. Shashi and the new ruling Zamorin Dynasty were both of the Nair
        caste, so Mani thought that perchance his friend would have some
        connection with them.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        To his delight, he was correct. Shashi had a blood tie to the new royal
        family through an old uncle who was present for the birth of the
        would-be Zamorin. Shashi decided to see his distant cousin to secure a
        possible position as a general and brought his industrious Mani along
        with him to meet the Zamorin after the parade that welcomed the new
        ruler to the city.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Mani and Shashi made their way to the city center, and after all the
        more prominent traders, chieftains, and religious leaders had paid
        homage, the two young men came up to talk with the old uncle as the
        chaperone. Shashi first introduced himself as a young relative
        interested in a position in the Zamorin’s army. He boasted about his
        mastery of the staff, spear, saber, and buckler in the Art of
        Kalaripayattu as well as his experience in the Tandav Dances that paid
        homage to Shiva. The Zamorin, thoroughly amused by the sharpness of the
        young man, said he would be willing to give his distant cousin a
        position as a field soldier or a post in the royal guard.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>Shashi’s disappointment was clearly visible on his face.</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        “Oh Great Prabhu, I have laid in front of you, without exaggerating, all
        of my competencies and I believe I should at least be an officer. I
        could defeat nearly any swordsman living on this side of the Western
        Ghats. I would prove myself by fighting your most decorated veteran. I
        would be willing to duel even with you, my Rajavu.”
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The Zamorin let out a hearty chuckle and spoke, “My, I have not seen you
        fight and cannot substantiate your claims myself, but I do believe you.
        Anyone willing to speak in such terms before me certainly must be able
        to support such boasts!” He dropped his smile and looked the proud
        fighter straight in his eyes, “These skills you have lavished me with
        are impressive, but to hold a higher rank and command soldiers, the
        fighting ability of you, yourself, is secondary to your ability to lead
        men in the art of war.”
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The Zamorin arose, “You may be able to cut me down here and now if we
        were to draw our swords here, but would you have the ability to expertly
        maneuver the cavalry? Would you know when to send the chariots or
        elephantry? Could you route the enemy? Can you live with the blood of
        hundreds on your hands?”
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        He paused for a moment to take in the young man, “ Have you ever killed
        a man before?”
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>“No I have not”</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Shashi stood there trying to digest everything that he had not yet
        considered. After some time he perked up and his eyes met the Zamorin’s
        again. The Zamorin then said, “To lead, a man needs to have a mind for
        it. Exercises in thought become more important than sparring with arms.”
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The Zamorin then turned to Mani. Upon seeing his stature he asked,”Why
        has a dock worker come to see me?”
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Mani corrected him,”I am Mani, a merchant from the harbor. I came to
        discuss the business of contracts.”
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>“I see. How many store houses do you have?”</p>
      <br />
      <p>“Only one, Your Majesty.”</p>
      <br />
      <p>“What do you ship?”</p>
      <br />
      <p>“Locally spun cotton, coconuts, mangos, sugar cane, and pepper.”</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Reclining into his seat and stroking his beard he said, “To be honest,
        it does not appear that you have the resources or capital to carry out
        good business.”
      </p>
      <p>
        For a moment, Mani felt the sharp sting of despair Shashi had felt
        moments before.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The Zamorin continued, “However, your name has managed to reach my ears.
        It seems that despite your setbacks, your reputation precedes you.”
        After a weighty pause, he continued, ``Very well,” getting up from his
        gem-encrusted chair, “I will give a test to all the tradesmen and
        shippers in the city, and whoever is shown to be the best will be
        awarded whichever monopoly they wish. If you win, you may be given full
        control of all gold and silver that enters and leaves the city of Koch,
        if that is your desire.”
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        “I will show you my worth, oh Great Prabhu, in any challenge you offer.”
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        “Hmm,” he crossed his arms and stroked his beard for a little while,
        “There will be two trials. First you must show me you have the wits to
        take on this task. A good merchant would be able to have the foresight
        and reason to maximize their profits. First you must best all of your
        opponents in a game of chathurangam.”
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        “I see, my Rajavu, I will show you that I have the abilities you
        require.”
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        “Then the next test will require you to show your strength and elegance
        in the martial arts. The superior Kalari warrior wins. Each contender
        will select a companion as an advisor or substitute for either trial.”
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>“Then so shall it be, My Rajavu. I solemnly wish to serve you.”</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The Zamorin sat back down and let out a hearty chuckle, “Good, good! The
        chathurangam matches will be held inside the Great Hall of Wonders. You
        will show your proficiency to not only myself, but also to the royal
        court. I believe my generals would be delighted to witness the strategic
        ingenuity the game may bring out.”
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The Zamorin got up and walked past the two and pointed out to the town
        square and said, “However, you will fight out there and will bare
        yourself to the people of Kochi.”
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Shashi asked himself, “Why would you test a merchant with a fight? Would
        not a different test be more appropriate?”
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Zamorin, as if reading his thoughts, replied, “We wish to see a fight.”
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        “I will do right by you. Now let me withdraw to prepare for your trials,
        Prabhu,” Mani said, then turned to Shashi, “Come, you will have to train
        with me for these next few days.”
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        “Of course,” and with a coy smirk he said, “But how will you repay me?”
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Mani leaned in and said, “If we are able to win this, we both gain favor
        with the Zamorin!”
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>They both departed.</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Mani reported the events of the day to his father, fearing his anger.
        However, the old louse smiled, saying, “Very good. Aha! Very good. You
        win, our house rises. You lose, a bastard falls. Go. Time off from work.
        Train, fight. Study. And eat.” As Mani walked off in gratitude, the old
        louse regarded him differently. The next morning, Mani got up early, and
        after checking with the house servants and workers, he went out to find
        Shashi bowing over a game board with a palm scroll open in his left hand
        as he studied the board.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        “I see you are already trying. What have you learned?” asked Mani
        standing over his friend.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        “I am still trying to get a handle on the rules. Have you played
        before?” Shashi replied, still staring at the board.
      </p>
      <br /><img
        class="center-img"
        src="https://cdn.glitch.global/376583ef-ed88-4183-8d24-6748303feef8/Chris%201.png?v=1656002762236"
      />

      <p>
        “Yes I have,” Mani said as he sat opposite. “My brother is quite good at
        it and he taught me how the pieces move and some opening techniques, but
        nothing more. I fear I may have to face him in the first part of the
        trials.”
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        “Well, today we should study. Once we are exhausted from learning, we
        can practice fighting.”
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        They proceeded to pour over the scroll and practice. Over time it became
        clear that Shashi had a mind for this game as with only a little
        experience he was able to maneuver and coordinate his pieces so that he
        was able to always catch Mani off guard. Many of the games ended in
        draws, but the extravagance of the play that Shashi exhibited was
        something Mani knew he would need. So until the sun was about to set,
        they played, after which they decided to spar with Shashi’s sabers.
        Though Mani was a meager salesman his long time friendship with Shashi
        gave him quite a good understanding in the manipulation of a sword. They
        both enjoyed swords and over the years, they fought whenever they had
        the chance. At the yearly games to make the monsoons, they observed
        closely the moves and techniques displayed at the city’s great contests.
        Shashi still was able to best him in most of their duels. Shashi
        reminded Mani of the techniques that had fallen out of practice
        alongside new ways of manipulating the blade and reading the enemy.
        After the sun had set and they could only see each other’s outlines,
        they decided to eat and part ways.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The next morning when they met Shashi was eager to begin their training
        at the board. Within only a few moves Shashi was able to easily mate his
        friend.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>“Where did you learn that?” asked Mani</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        His friend then pulled out a large, moth-eaten palm scroll and held it
        out. “In here.”
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        They spent the rest of the day focusing on the interplay of the pieces,
        coordination of attacks, and attempting to predict the opponent’s moves.
        In between games, they would consult the old book on strategies. This
        time they played well into the night and did not stop until the torch
        they lit prior had gone out.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The next two days that continued training, dividing roughly half of each
        day between exercises of each kind. They decided it would be easier if
        they lived together for that time so as to not waste any time and so
        they could spend meals and the time before bed discussing tactics and
        going over moves.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Soon the fifth day came and the two made their way to the palace. They
        greeted the Zamorin and his generals and lined up with the other
        contestants. There were roughly a dozen other contenders looking to get
        royal favor and each had a second to confer with. Among them were a few
        officers who wanted to entertain themselves. One of the others was
        Inasu, Mani’s elder brother. He was wearing some finer clothes from
        their father’s wardrobe and behind him stood a giant. The large man was
        stocky and well built. He had a simple look to him and seemed to stare
        off into the distance even as everyone was bustling around him. Only
        when the bugler played his horn did the oaf begin to listen. The Zamorin
        then laid out the format of the competition.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Mani’s first opponent was another merchant, an Arab, who obviously had
        come to the Zamorin already possessing some wealth. He had a long,
        graying beard and sat in a robe of Chinese silk. His second was a
        servant who brought him refreshments from time to time. This opponent
        was sharp, but not familiar with the rules of this form of the game. He
        made some illegal moves in the opening which spurred chastisement from
        the proctor. From then he played slow and thought hard on which moves to
        make. Though he played well in the beginning, the complex position of
        the late game led to his loss just before the chance for a break had
        come.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        After the match, the Arab congratulated Mani and they spoke a little
        about the game and themselves. Apparently this man had already built up
        a trade corporation operating in other cities in the region and was also
        very proficient with his form of the game, shatranj, but differing rules
        prevented him from exactly understanding his position. The first
        opponent and his second then departed.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Mani looked around and saw that his brother had already defeated his
        opponent and was observing another game that was playing out between two
        generals.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Shashi came to him and told him his play was good, but that Arab would
        have been a far more difficult opponent had he been more familiar with
        the game.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Within half an hour all the other preliminary games were over, and one
        of the proctors had marked the new standings on the front board. There
        were now only six contestants left in the running, and Mani’s next
        opponent was to be an old man. This man had a stark white beard and
        tired eyes, he had wrapped his head with a white cloth to match the
        cheap, yet clean linens he wore to the Zamorin’s tournament. His second
        was a built young man, only a little older than Mani stood, without a
        shirt. Both had deep, dark complexions and warm smiles.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        This old man introduced himself and the second, and Mani did the same
        back. These two were father and son, both dock workers, who spent their
        days moving cargo on and off ships. The old man said he had taken up
        chathurangam in his youth and continued to play into his more advanced
        age. He stated that if he won this round, his son may be able to best
        his opponent in the duel. With their winning, they wanted to be granted
        the contract for management and upkeep of the dock.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        After this polite conversation, the two began their game. Mani led with
        the white pieces and opened with a defensive setup. The old dock worker
        began attacking with his black pieces. He quickly sacrificed a couple of
        his kalals, soldiers, and immediately had established dominance of his
        king’s side of the board. Mani realized this counter to his opening was
        one that he and Shashi had seen before in the scrolls. Mani looked up to
        meet eyes with his old opponent, but the old man did not take his eyes
        from the table. Behind his beard and sun-worn face were the eyes of a
        younger man, someone who was not going to make this a simple game.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Mani quickly closed the hole in his position, rerouted his elephant, and
        tucked away his king. The old man immediately began repositioning his
        pieces to target the king’s new square. The two maneuvered their pieces
        around each other for a few moves, seldom giving up only a single
        soldier from time to time. On the fifty-first move, the old man thought
        for a while as he stroked his beard. He advanced one of his kalal pieces
        as the bugler informed the room that the players may now take a break.
        Mani got up to get some water and talk with Shashi about his current
        position. As he looked back he saw the old man continue to quietly study
        the board while shooing away his son who came to offer some
        refreshments.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Shashi hastily gave his assessment of the position and reminded Mani of
        how the old scroll told them to approach this specific arrangement on
        the board. They discussed move orders and piece structure for a time.
        The bugler blew his horn again and they returned to their games. Mani
        began by capturing a kalal from the old man with one of his own which
        was quickly taken itself. He then slowly attacked and pushed his
        opponent’s pieces to the edge of the board, all huddled around the black
        king. Between each move the players spent more and more time deciding on
        the next. In the end, the Mani was able to checkmate the man in white by
        use of the radham, the chariot, in conjunction with his rajjngi, queen.
        The old man looked down at the board for a while and then looked back up
        at Mani. He praised Mani’s masterful play and then he and his son
        departed.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Then there were three left: Mani, his brother, and a general of the
        Zamorin. The general came to the brothers and said he resigned on
        account of it being unseemly for a warrior to compete among the
        merchants. The Zamorin offered an hour break to eat, after which the
        finalists and a large crowd of nobles, businessmen, and the other
        competitors reconvened in the temporary court. The two brothers sat and
        set up their pieces. As they got ready, a servant to the Zamorin came up
        and told him of the situation. The Zamorin ordered him to discover and
        report everything about the family. Collecting his knowledge and making
        a few inquiries, he informed his lord that the finalists were brothers,
        that Mani is an illegitimate son, and that family lore held that some
        hereditary mark would dictate who becomes the head of the household.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The board was set, the Inasu had the white pieces and Mani had the
        black. The horn was sounded to start the final match. Inasu began by
        moving an elephant piece while Mani slowly advanced the soldiers in
        front of his king. The way the pieces ended up laid out after the first
        hour and a half was very imbalanced. The opposing chariots and elephants
        were eyeing each other on black king-side of the board while Inasu had
        lost most of his pawns in exchange for both of Mani’s horse pieces. The
        game was still more or less even until Mani attempted to make a play for
        one of his brother’s elephants. He miscalculated and in exchange for one
        of the remaining soldiers and the elephants, Mani lost three pawns and
        was checked by his brother. After shielding the black king with a
        chariot piece, the Zamorin offered a recess, which the two eagerly
        accepted.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Mani went to consult again with Shashi, who himself was concerned for
        the black king’s position. Both saw that despite Mani having more
        material, the positional advantage still remained in the hands of his
        brother. After some quite pondering, Shashi said, “ you must sacrifice
        your queen and trade chariots with him.”
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        “Are you sure? There must be a safer way to play than to give up so
        much?” replied Mani, “ What if I trade chariots then take his horse
        using my elephant?”
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        “That will not work, as he will easily checkmate you with his queen and
        chariot before you are able to execute the attack. If you begin the next
        play with anything other than moving your king and giving up the queen
        for some of his pieces, you cannot win.”
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        They debated some more, but Mani finally capitulated. They worked out
        the precise order required and took into account as many possible moves
        from Inasu in order to win. Soon after their deliberation, Mani wearily
        returned to the board where Inasu was already waiting for him.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        As planned, Mani allowed Inasu to take two soldiers as he moved the
        black king to a safer square. Then he then moved his queen into the line
        of sight of a white chariot with its queen behind it. Without
        hesitation, Inasu smirked smugly and captured it. Mani took back with
        his own chariot which was then taken by the white queen waiting at the
        end of the rank. The diversion of this chariot provided an opening that
        Inasu did not consider until after he had already moved the piece. This
        opening allowed for Mani to plant an elephant on a square protected by a
        white chariot close to the white king. The Inasu attempted to draw the
        white queen into play, but she was so far from the king that Inasu did
        not have enough moves to prevent his brother from moving his chariot
        right in front of the white king to a square protected by the elephant.
        There was no square to escape to and the queen was not in a position to
        capture neither the enemy elephant nor black’s chariot. Inasu had been
        checkmated.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The crowd stood for a second studying the board until the generals
        realized that it was over and came up to Mani to congratulate him on the
        game as the rest of the onlookers began to chatter. The Zamorin also
        came down from his throne to speak to Mani.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        “That was an impressive game. You have proven that you possess ample
        intellect, but you must also best your enemy with your sword tomorrow.
        The town square of Kochi will be the meeting place.”
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        “Thank you my Prabu, I would not have been able to win this match had it
        not been for Shashi,” he said, gesturing to his friend. “He has also
        trained me with the sword and buckler so I may have a chance of winning
        the Kalari duel.”
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        “Hmmm, well I see he may make something of a commander, but I will also
        be looking to you to see the style of fight he has imparted upon you.” A
        servant comes and whispers in the Zamorin’s ear. “I have other matters
        to attend to boy, I bid you farewell” and he exited the hall.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Shashi met Mani on his way out informing him, “you will be fighting
        Inasu’s second, the towering oaf!”
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>“Can he not face me himself?”</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        “I do not know why your brother has decided to send such a grizzly
        opponent for you to battle, but you should rest now. You will need it”
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The tournament had begun at midday and had gone for so long that as they
        exited the hall they stepped into the street only illuminated by a full
        moon. They returned to their quarters to sleep. The next morning, before
        the rooster crowed, they woke up, stretched, and quickly sparred to warm
        Mani up. They then made their way to the town square and met the Zamorin
        along with a small crowd who coalesced to see the fight put on for him.
        Soon after Inasu and his giant showed up and the crowd around the arena
        grew.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The Zamorin had his servant draw a large circle with chalk as other men
        held back the crowd before he eased into his jewel-inlaid chowkie
        throne. The bugler decreed: “The first to pacify, or kill, the other
        while in this circle will win my favor.”
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The Mani and the Giant stepped into the ring and were each handed a
        saber and buckler and then allowed to pray. The oaf looked down at Mani,
        standing nearly two heads taller. They touched the ends of their swords
        and the fight began. The giant began by lurching forward and swinging
        with his whole arm. Mani rolled out of the way and looked back to see
        his opponent cut the nose of a man standing outside of the circle.
        During the next swipe, Mani was able to catch his enemy’s blade and
        tried to slash at the giant’s exposed chest. Before he was able to
        strike the blow the giant had dropped his shield and grabbed Mani’s leg
        then pulled it out from under him.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Mani broke free of the giant's grasp and realized he could not fight
        this brute like he had sparred with Shashi. He looked at how the large
        man moved, his posture, and his stance. Mani came to the conclusion that
        though his form is poor and his stance leaves a lot of openings when he
        swings, the mere size of his opponent leaves too much distance to strike
        a blow. Mani worked the arms and legs of the giant, whenever he swung,
        Mani would catch the blade and slice the wrist or the inside of the
        elbow. Wherever the giant exposed his shin or left his foot too far in
        front, Mani would cut there.
      </p>
      <br />

      />
      <br />
      <p>
        Before too long, the giant had begun to stagger, yet Mani was still able
        to evade all his swings easily. The giant tired and his sword and shield
        seemed to weigh him down. He dropped the sword, hoping to crush Mani
        with his shield or use it to ward off any blow. Here, Mani saw his
        opening. As the brute lumbered forward, his shoulder lifted and then his
        elbow began to raise as he prepared to smash his shield across Mani’s
        chest. Mani feigned his opponent by making it look as though he was
        going to cleave at the giant’s shield bearing arm. At the last moment he
        leaped high, drew his sword, and slashed deep into the giant’s exposed
        thigh. He tried to grab at Mani, but he could catch only his shirt,
        tearing it off as he tried to steady himself. Mani, behind the kneeling
        giant, held the saber to his throat.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The crowd cheered as Mani restrained the giant. The Zamorin instructed
        the bugler to blow his horn and the fight’s end. Mani left the giant as
        a bewildered Inasu came to examine the sorry state of his champion. He
        looked up as Mani walked away and his eyes widened. The townspeople and
        the Zamorin all saw what he did. Shashi yelled out and grabbed his
        friend, unable to contain his disbelief, “Mani, that mark! You have the
        mark…above your left shoulder blade….reddish. You must be the true
        heir!”
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        A murmur arose among the townspeople, rising to an excited pitch. The
        Zamorin, recalling the report of his spy on Mani, his family, and their
        legend of the birthmark, rose. The crowd hushed. “That was some
        excellent fighting. Even if you lost, it would have been quite the
        show,” he said with an air of bemused gravity. His tone changed, “You
        have shown more than you may have intended. That mark above your left
        shoulder grants you, by your family law, the rights and privileges of
        inheritance. As the household is the sacred foundation of our kingdom,
        it is Our royal duty to uphold the prerogatives of the householder. You,
        Mani, stand here invested.” The crowd roared its approval. After a
        little, he raised his right hand and the crowd hushed: “You have brought
        recognition to your family, to your brother, and to your father.” His
        eyes descended upon Insau and then the louse of a father. The crowd
        followed his gaze then refocused on him as he declared, “By the terms of
        these contests, you have secured your claim to your choice of trading
        rights. Young man, your mother, indeed, is honored in you.”
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Mani had looked back and understood why his mother always told him to
        wear a shirt with nearly religious commitment whenever he left his own
        room, even if he were to stay within the perimeter of the family house.
        Though she died when he was ten, her priority was to protect him from
        the jealousy and ire of his half-brother and stepmother. She knew that
        his louse of a father would never protect him.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Mani presented himself in front of the Zamorin and kneeling, asked,
        “Would you grant me and my descendants the Monopoly on Gold and Silver
        for Kochi under the Kingdom of Calicut?”
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        “So it shall be, my champion, my ministers will draw up a contract that
        gives you, and your successors, control of all trade involving ingots of
        gold and silver that travel through this city. I will also grant you
        authority to store and deal in fine textiles, spices, tea, and iron.
        Both foreign and domestic. Along with that authority, you will be
        granted plots for warehouses and factories advantageously positioned
        adjacent to the docks along with an office in the center of Kochi to
        communicate freely with my appointed vicar. You will be supplied dock
        workers, servants, carpenters, and salt-makers as needed. Your property
        and your land will be exempt from taxes levied either by this city or
        the Kingdom of Calicut. Is there anything else you wish?”
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        “Would you also allow me to build a tomb of marble for my late mother?”
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        “Granted, my champion,” the Zamorin waved his hand and his vizir left to
        draft the document.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        After all this, Mani threw a tremendous feast for all the townspeople,
        accommodating every faith and every occupation in attendance. After
        receiving the contract before the Zamorin’s court and all the ensuing
        pagentries, Mani prepared to travel north to Karnataka to attend the
        merchant guild meeting. Becoming the premier dealer in noble metals for
        Kochi, by hand of the Zamorin, made this the primary obligation of his
        new position. Before he departed, he saw Shashi at the vicar’s office.
        He admired his new white garments with gold trim and the glimmering
        ceremonial saber that he wore at his hip. After, he prayed at his
        mother’s tomb, then departed to take his position among the 500 Lords of
        Ayyavolu.

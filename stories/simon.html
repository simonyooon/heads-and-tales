    <p>
      As the song of our beginnings has it: parity drives the human race to the
      verge of extinction. Hopelessness plagues the world and the world order is
      awry. The reins of the world exist in the possession of a powerful,
      autonomous few. Desperation leads them to turn to the supernatural in
      hopes of salvation.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      We accept our end, having sullied the world beyond repair. Seeking
      repentance, we forgo our form.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>Through the forbidden exchange, we no longer need.</p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Bound by ancestral covenant and sins we seek forgiveness for, the cursed
      people wander. They are forced to walk the Amatas, an endless desert where
      once oceans churned.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>The group walks with no end in sight.</p>
    <br />
    <p>
      In Amatas, time grinds to a halt, an everlasting present. The sun and moon
      stand still in the sky, shrouded by fog of ashen earth. The nights and
      days, the weeks and months dissolve. And the pale quartz sand stretches to
      the furthest edges.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      As their will wanes, a formless Amalgam offers a proposition. It offers
      them freedom from their plight by granting them knowledge of their
      condition, but in exchange will claim the mind of the Wisher.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      The eldest warns the travelers of the venomous bargain. He recounts the
      trauma of their ruin to all. But, the temptations draw ears and entice the
      heart, stronger than any siren song. That very night, the youngest,
      lacking the strength to resist its call, approaches it.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>Such a tender glow in this endless dark.</p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Wisher, but a poor, intrepid child, cannot sense the air’s heavy malice.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Amalgam extends its phantom limb. It reveals to him that it once bestowed
      a power to his first ancestors. Wisher reaches out and his very being
      begins to cohere with the entity. His mind is overwhelmed by Amalgam’s
      revelation.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      He sees three drifting through Amatas. And by identical fate, they
      encounter an offer that grants them a formidable power. At their will,
      they could supplant the consciousness of their child with their own. The
      two argue. At every other moment, one challenges the other for a claim
      over the child, swearing by their moralities and suppressing opposing
      thoughts.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      The autonomy of the child is stripped and rewritten countless times. Long
      after the two grew silent, war rages in the lonesome mind as it retaliates
      against oppressors of its own creation. The immense pressure besieges the
      brittle mind.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>The child’s mind, delicate like glass, is fragmented irreparably.</p>
    <br />
    <p>Each shard seeded the minds of the future.</p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Wisher can now see the poison in his roots. Amalgam reveals the memories
      of all to have come before him and the endless cycle of destruction his
      people have self-inflicted.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>The ideals that motivate such violence and torment…</p>
    <br />
    <p>Protecting oneselves in annihilating the other… the irony…</p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Amalgam withdraws Wisher from the vision. And within himself and his
      people, he sees but the singular and lonely mind, fractured infinitely,
      unknowing of how to put itself back together.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>And in claiming Wisher, Amalgam claims them all.</p>
    <br />
    <p>
      In this limbo, as his mind is stripped, he regrets. The eternal
      sterilization of the minds of his people or this endless misery. Perhaps
      there was another way.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>A future unlike the revelations.</p>
    <br />
    <p>
      One of harmony and where difference bred growth instead of vitriol. One of
      warmth and nurture, freedom from doom and impotence. Wisher cries out in a
      tempest of emotion.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      As the souls of his people travel to Amalgam’s grasp, Wisher’s cries are
      heard. Sensations they once lacked the faculties to even comprehend
      overwhelm their being. They are immersed in Wisher’s future of such
      beautiful promise. They cry out to each other in euphoria, despair,
      comfort, and disappointment. Knowing they won’t see another day of any
      future, they let their imaginations wander in Wisher’s dream, envisioning
      their lives in this blissful and perfect alternate universe.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>… at least it all might just be over.</p>
    <br />
    <p>Wisher does not know it, but he has saved them all.</p>
    <br />
    <p>They all dream deeply of their own unique and beautiful present.</p>
    <br />
    <p>
      When the lightning struck, gentle like falling ash, the souls collected
      neatly in the sand…
    </p>

    <p>My Dear Students of Hum 243--Summer 2022,</p>
    <br />
    <br />
    <p>
      In creating our syllabus for this year, I was pretty confident that we
      would produce another edition of our anthology,
      <em>Heads & Tales.</em> The inaugural edition came out of the fall 2019
      class and in summer 2021, we created the second edition. While the fall
      seemed ideal–more time for creation and revision, and the Thanksgiving
      break–summer 2021 proved what our students’ famed brilliance, diligence,
      and drive could create in 5 weeks. So, I stated our objective to create
      <em>Heads & Tales 2022</em> boldly in our course description.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      As I write, we are still writing, editing, and curating our tales, and
      creating our website. This, however, is not because of procrastination or
      indifference. Far from it: it speaks to your creative restlessness,
      ingenuity, and professionalism, to your determination to invest all of
      your selves into perfecting, as far as possible, a project to which you
      are committed. I am amazed at your resilience and tenacity: you have
      joined class from your bedrooms and workplaces, from Germany and Mexico,
      and even while commuting. We also all shared and witnessed our feelings of
      fatigue, guilt, anxiety, and depression–whether in waves or like a
      weighted blanket. I do not, and have never taken for granted the
      struggles, labor and dedication that go into your genius.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      As in years past, you volunteered for the boards and appointed their
      heads. You were perhaps the most collaborative team so far, as many of you
      served on multiple boards as contributors and liaisons, and you pitched in
      to help wherever it was needed. You wrote such amazing stories drawing
      from your experiences and cultural influences, designed multiple original
      artworks in consultation with the tales’ authors, and performed editorial
      functions. You secured the host for our site, coordinated all the efforts
      required, and designed the digital text. And you did this all remotely in
      a semester when some of us would have benefitted from the immediacy of
      in-person teaching.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      I created this course back in 2014 in response to various needs I saw in
      the HSS curriculum: for greater interdisciplinarity, for more
      creative-based offerings and projects, for more inclusive pedagogy, and
      for greater recognition of student labor and effort over a semester. So,
      it was wonderful to see HUM 243: The Fairy Tale cited for innovative
      pedagogy in the report of recommendations from the Visiting Committee for
      Humanities and Social Sciences, 2022. Whether or not I will teach this
      course again, I hope that it continues to be offered, that future classes
      continue reading and analyzing the tales of the world’s traditions and
      continue them with new editions of <em>Heads & Tales.</em>

      undying gratitude, admiration, and respect.

      "I wanted to write about something lighthearted and funny, something I’ve
      never done before. There had to be a big emphasis on the setting and the
      bright and colorful nature of a town. My grandmothers’ roots are in Spain,
      and she’d always talk about the cobblestone streets and sweet smells of
      the countryside, so I thought that was a perfect place to land. Sadly, I
      was cursed with being lactose intolerant and if you know anything about
      Spanish people you know that cheese is not an if but a when. The idea of
      designing a kingdom that reflects myself and what inevitably happens when
      my body is no longer able to protect me. I mean how weak really, I’m down
      because of a slice of pizza?! Having the kingdom crumble to its knees
      because of this cunning intruder and knowing very well that it will suffer
      for about 4 to 5 hours but will forget about the next day was hilarious to
      me. I mean no one really talks about how embarrassing but humorous it is
      to be lactose intolerant so why not me." - Amanda

     <p>"My story was inspired by thoughts about what it was that made trees able to grow in theinteresting ways that they do, what that can tell about the way we can use our own intellect todo what it is that we will do. A tree that is able to live so long could not be living a painfulexistence, otherwise it would find ways to make its life easier to live, which is something onlyhumans do. Then I started thinking about if trees know what it is like to be a human and all ofthe impatiences and interesting ways that we go about thinking and doing things. Then I startedto consider what would happen if a really impressive tree that lived its life in a normal way gotturned into a human, realized all of these stress points, and began to think like a human, andthen got turned back into a tree. And what I imagined would happen is that it would becomeself-conscious, and start to grow in a sort of unnatural way, like looking first at the other treesand trying to make the branches look like them, and then looking at the different things around itto try and understand itself by looking at everything else, and it would be possibly unhappybecause it would have to live a tree’s lifespan with a human’s patience.It is about a girl who turns a tree into a person for company, and takes him to into a town withdifferent people who introduce him to human ways of thinking. After some time of being with thepeople, he loses the way of thinking when he was a tree and when he is eventually turned backinto a tree, he has lost his form and must live as a tree while thinking like a person." - Anahita</p>

      "Lately I’ve been interested in the pop-culture phenomenon of Vampires,
      and why out of all fairy tale legends and monsters, vampires have been
      regurgitated so many times in so many ways. I also love how stupid or camp
      a lot of vampire re-boots are. I started with the idea of a vampire, and
      ended up with writing something in a more serious tone. To me, the main
      element of being a vampire is immortality at the cost of having a cursed
      life - there’s always a lesson in how morality is what makes life worth
      living. I wondered if a Vampire could represent traditions that have gone
      on too long, or states of decay. In my story, I have a vampire help save a
      family from the old Hindu tradition of Sati, or widow burning, by passing
      on the curse to the daughter of the family. There is a long and
      controversial history of Sati, in pre and post colonial India, that holds
      a lot of nuances I wanted to try and point to. Mainly, my character is a
      young woman like me, having to reckon with the new and old, traditions
      that are violent, and the space between being a dutiful daughter vs,
      ultimately, a lawless vampiric “monster”. " - Ananya

      work using mostly photography, video, and sculpture. I’m interested in
      performance and documentary, and think of my work as a way to connect to
      the people and things I care about. I like combining this with fantasy and
      imaginary elements as well. I’m really excited to be taking a course in
      set and costume design at Central Saint Martins this summer, and I can’t
      wait to combine all the things I enjoy into a potential career. Big love
      to everyone in the class and Ramdass who made this project so cool!

      "In my tale, I wanted the ladybugs to have agency as a collective to bring
      interest and perspective to the way they maneuvered themselves. A ladybug
      can be meaningful by itself, but what would it mean to see thousands at
      once congregating in a space. I wanted a spectacle that is just as
      beautiful as it is imperceivable and abstract. I focused on creating an
      arbitrary scene that didn't really reveal why the ladybugs were there to
      begin with, but would show that their existence is justified just by the
      sheer magnitude of their presence in this form. I tried to craft a story
      that revolved around solitude, faith, and patience. For me, this was about
      the character learning to make something of what is there in the present
      moment and not needing a reason or explanation to trust herself and feel
      joy." - Cesar

      work through several mediums like photography and painting but I have
      always been focused on drawing primarily. Organizing information and
      contextualizing research is of interest to me, so I use design often to
      tie my ideas together. Recently I’ve been looking at transportation and
      topography of different landscapes in my work to visualize stories and
      sensations, like sound and texture. In the future I want to be working
      with others to discover new patterns and ideas about the areas we inhabit
      and continue to create both expressive and designed work that can be
      offered back into the world with care. Big shoutout to my high school
      English teacher Ms.Rodriguez for having the passion for her work that I
      hope to continue striving for with my own endeavors.

      "I originally wanted my story to be set in northern Italy in a small
      principality/fiefdom with a plot that would center around the plot device
      of a hereditary mark that appears on the chosen heir of a family. I was
      also going to make the protagonist more cunning than he ended up being in
      the end. I mean like he was meant to be machiavellian, never showing his
      hand until the last moment.I wanted to draw inspiration from the Italian
      fairy tales we read in class like “Costanza/Constanzo” and “Cat
      Cinderella.” Instead, through the course of writing everything, that idea
      eventually was kind of dropped. The aspect of the mark remained in the
      story and was expanded upon to specifically center around the conflict
      between a younger, illegitimate son and his elder brother. The general
      gist of the plot became: The elder brother is slated to inherit the
      family’s things due to his legitimacy while the more competent son is
      looked over, how will the younger son prove himself? The idea to make the
      two duke it out in a competition to prove the protagonist’s worth came
      from a lot of the multiple stories that we read in class, but I was also
      kind of inspired by remembering Penelope and the suitors from the Odyssey
      who tried to resolve a domestic dispute using by a somewhat militaristic
      method, bowmanship, which is pretty arbitrary in determining how good
      these men would be as husbands. The whole thing ends up as a blood bath
      anyways. In lieu of a blood bath, my tale instead concludes with a sword
      fight. Since all the two sons are fighting over is a commercial contract
      for selling goods in the city, my story also follows the classical
      classical tradition of using violence to solve things that don’t really
      require it. Over time the setting was eventually moved to somewhere
      generally in southern India long ago, but I eventually settled
      specifically in Kerala circa 14th-15th century because that is a place I
      have the most personal experience since my family is from there. This
      state in southwestern India was the site of a lot of trade that occurred
      over the years across the Indian Ocean from the shores of Madagascar to
      the Strait of Malacca. Various peoples and groups came to interact from
      these routes, like there was a community of Jews in the large port cities,
      Christianity made its way to India in the 1st century, and there’s a
      legend that a local king traveled to Arabia to meet the Prophet Mohammad
      during his lifetime. The global connections of the pre-UN world are rarely
      discussed unless they grew into something that’s relevant to modern
      geopolitics. Plenty of books have diverse casts of people that come from
      places that are called by a different name today or may not exist in any
      form today, and though it may be simply a minor detail in the greater
      scheme of the story, I personally relish in finding archaic words used for
      peoples and places in the past. When reading Moby Dick and My Name is Red,
      I was exposed to so many new words that I don’t think I would have ever
      come to know any other way. These books gave me an interesting perspective
      that many history textbooks cannot, they allow you to see through the eyes
      of people who lived on a whaling ship from Nantucket or in the medieval
      Ottoman Empire. If I had the time I would have put more effort into trying
      to incorporate that all encompassing kind of atmosphere along with trying
      to fit a more machiavellian plot into the whole thing." - Chris

      "The writing of my story “perceptive potato” came from personal
      experiences. The personal experience that inspired my story's themes was
      how society perceived knowledge and intellect. Growing up, especially in
      an Asian household, there exists so many standards which children are held
      upon until they reach college. The stereotypical grade A student who would
      then become a doctor or lawyer was something I experienced. However after
      becoming more educated about the possibilities that exist for so many
      people who didnt attend college, it really shook my world. I was always
      taught that there is a standard and if it isn't met, you would be valued
      as lower. This was all I knew growing up. I was told to get the best
      grades, and the best job because it would make the most money in the end,
      and although they aren’t entirely wrong, they aren't entirely right
      either. I wanted to touch on the fact that these standards, these tests,
      and all we are striving to learn, at its core aren’t important even though
      society places so much value on them. It's the only standard that people
      rely on which makes it so important. So, the themes I wanted to pin point
      were selflessness, inner value and intelligence, and lastly expressing
      differences. I tried to implement a blind man who knew a lot as a way to
      give duality in what knowledge entails because he would only be an
      auditorial learner. This limits his comprehensibility but in the end it
      was revealed that he was also able to obtain the book. My main character
      had a difference which wasn’t welcomed as much as it should be, and in
      consequence showed how much people are afraid of change. This was one of
      my only creative writings since elementary school. It was very interesting
      because in the beginning I had nothing creative to write about. I didn’t
      know what problems and themes I wanted to highlight, where the story would
      take place, or even the fairy-tale aspect of my story. Getting past all of
      this, I let my mind wander and I really enjoyed piecing together a story
      that I found interesting. I listed a bunch of ideas, plots, themes, and
      qualities that I wanted included in my story and tried to align them best
      as possible to make the story as logical as it can. My story would be
      about a boy that although viewed as less, is worth so much more but
      society finds it hard to see that. His genetic anomaly would pin on the
      fact that everyone is kind of the same but he’s different, willing to take
      a new path to the same-ish goal. The inspiration for the class names came
      from my love for potato variations and character name from shows/animes I
      have been loving. Shinra is the main character of an anime called Fire
      Force and he has a genetic anomaly, this causes society to view him as a
      devil but he's trying to prove to everyone he can be a hero (very similar
      for a reason). The Arsenals are like the grimoires from an anime called
      Black Clover (a wizard anime where the grimoires are personal spell
      books). Lastly the trials were generated from my love for puzzles and
      characters who are really smart and can think outside the box. Originally
      my story was going to be about greed and selflessness entirely because
      those stories make me feel good when the humble being gets rewarded while
      the greedy get jealous. But I wanted something more meaningful deep down
      like all the stories we have read so far. So as previously stated, I
      jotted down themes and problems to address and this is where all my
      problems arose. It was like working my story backwards because there were
      ideas that would be written but wouldn’t align with the story so I had to
      pick and choose what would work and what would make my story too
      confusing. Working with my classmates of HUM 243 has been such a good
      experience. Being surrounded by such talented students who have the
      ability to write amazing stories and illustrate them has been really
      eye-opening. I love the way they have been so cooperative with their
      groups and how they are so versatile with their roles. I have such a
      skilled group for the book production and such a talented artist who
      helped better visualize my story (Natalia Salas Porras). If given more
      time I would detail my story more so it can be read more easily and have
      the themes more easily attained. I feel as if my story only dabbles in the
      themes for short amounts of time thus not making it an essential theme.
      With more time I can better bridge the themes and plot together. However,
      with the time being, I am glad I was able to give Professor Ramdass a good
      read, because he claimed that he really enjoyed it. " - Eugene

      some other students trying to make our school more energy efficient.
      Besides my major, I am very interested in the entertainment industry and
      would like to put myself out there to give people laughs through social
      media and other entertainment software. Currently, I find myself trying to
      pursue a career in either energy efficiency, control systems, or product
      development. If I manage to get a job early after graduating I would like
      to pursue a Masters while working. However, this is all very up in the air
      because the future is too hard to predict.

      "When I had the chance to take an English elective this summer, Fairy
      Tales stood out to me because I don’t have much experience with the genre
      despite loving fiction books. I remember reading the Cinderella stories
      and discussing them as a class. The stories were more complex and
      intentional than I realized in my first reading. I underestimated the
      depth of fairy tales at first but after class I was inspired to read more
      closely and think more deeply. Soon after, we did “Ode to Mulan” which
      became one of my favorite stories ever. The writing was so beautiful.
      Repetition was used often but it never dragged the story, instead it was
      concise and elegant. The story felt so timeless, grounded in both the
      setting of past China and in the fundamental experience of gender. The
      message was provocative but mature and respectful of all perspectives. The
      character had little dialogue or direct characterization but felt so real
      and layered. It surprised me that such a great story had no author
      accredited, but that only added to the intrigue for me. When we had to
      make our own fairy tale, I wanted to write one like Ode to Mulan. To write
      something good, I would need a solid understanding of whatever subject
      matter I wrote about. I decided to model my character and story about my
      own life and the struggles I had and lessons I learned. It always feels
      too personal to write about my life but fairy tales allow me to use
      symbolism and story telling to give myself some anonymity. The main themes
      I decided to tackle are physical and sexual violence, lack of identity,
      and the search for meaning. These are pretty broad themes so I decided
      that I needed more than one character. This led me to my first plot point,
      the main character who represented me would split into 4 characters who
      would each allow me to demonstrate some part of my life. Each character
      represents different parts of my life, the youngest being childhood and
      each character afterwards being a maturation of the last. I decided at the
      end the characters would reform into one being. Mirroring my process of
      reflection on my life and the reintegration of old memories. I am proud of
      how the plot worked out. I feel pre-planning my structure helped me a lot.
      When I read the finished story, the pacing is one aspect I feel happy
      about. My story is 1879 words long which is not too long for having 4 main
      characters and multiple settings and mini-plots. My structure led me to
      have an abrupt and unresolved ending. I like this too because it aligns
      with where I am regarding understanding my own life right now. If I
      offered any clear stance or solutions to the dilemmas faced by my
      character, they would be premature and not well thought out. If I could do
      this over, I would make each character more unique from each other. I
      struggled with characterization because I wanted to plot to move quickly.
      In Ode to Mulan, most of the characterization was indirect and was worked
      masterfully so as to not delay the plot. I am not skilled enough yet to
      pull that off. Also, I would make more time for writing. Finally, I would
      discuss my story with my classmates more to make my story way better. I
      also enjoyed the process of doing editorials. If the class was longer, I
      would love to do another round. My classmates' stories are really good.
      I'm glad we are sharing them with each other so I can read everyone's

      "The Witch is the first fairy tale and the first creative writing piece I
      have written, which provided a great challenge for me. Since this would be
      my first time writing this genre, I wanted a topic that I am familiar
      with. For this reason, this fairy tale is inspired by my personal
      experience in middle school, where I witnessed one of my close friends
      being physically and verbally bullied, and I was tremendously impacted by
      being friends with her. At times, the experience vividly relives itself,
      and the scene of bullying, as well as the overwhelming helplessness, still
      impacts me. In order to accurately convey this feeling, I wrote the fairy
      tale the same way I experienced it–in the first person, and I formatted it
      as a diary: I wanted this to be authentic. I hope that the tragic end to
      the diary’s keeper strikes a chord and stimulates some reflection. When
      deciding on the setting, I based it on my middle school but also added
      elements of magic, ghosts, and witchcraft. The fantastic elements were
      added to blur the boundary between reality and imagination. It also allows
      the inquisition about whether the main character is hallucinating. One
      particular challenge for me in writing this fairy tale is that I have
      never written a diary in English before. My writing encountered a few
      issues such as being too formal and not matching the casual tone expected
      of a diary. However, after some suggestions and editing, I was able to
      overcome this issue. The feedback from the professor and my editor helped
      a lot with my writing by providing different perspectives and making my
      prose match a middle schooler. Overall, I enjoyed writing this fairy tale
      since it enabled me to express my creativity. I am especially proud of how
      I added depth to the story by creating a plot twist: the reveal of a
      double diary and the doctor’s note. This subverts the reader’s
      expectations and makes it more interesting to read since the reader gets
      to slowly piece together details before the reveal. " - Jiah

      "Since I was a child, I’ve always enjoyed fairytales. As early as I can
      remember, I would stay up well past my bedtime and read old fairy tales by
      lamplight. There was something about the gritty illustrations and the
      strange twists which really drew me in. A few years back, I was perusing
      the shelves in a dusty bookstore in Lake Placid, way north in the
      Adirondacks, and a particular book caught my eye. It was a beautifully
      illustrated book of Scandinavian folk tales, translated into English. That
      book got me interested in fairytales again; to me, there was a sense of
      childlike wonder about them. For me, fairytales aren’t necessarily
      governed by rules, random things can just happen with no rhyme or reason,
      and that’s why I like them so much. And because the rules are so loose and
      free the format allows for ample exploration of that which is absurd and
      uncanny. For some reason, I keep remembering this short story called “A
      Very Old Man with Enormous Wings” by Gabriel Garcia Marquez. The setting
      is not a fairytale world, with witches and kingdoms; it’s just a fishing
      village. But absurd things happen, and Marquez adds in fairy tale elements
      to dig at how humans are cruel or compassionate to those who are dependent
      or different. He juxtaposes the characters’ compassion to their child with
      the callousness to the old man, whom they decide to cast away until they
      realize they can profit off of him. In the end, it’s a fairy tale which
      mocks the catholic church and human nature. And I think that’s where
      fairytales fall short. They idealize the main character, who is the
      fairest or purest or kindest or bravest, and they’re clever, so they
      outsmart the bad guy. Those stories are perfectly fine and alright, but I
      feel like the fairytale format can explore far more than teaching children
      good morals. For instance, the classic film Howl’s Moving Castle from
      Studio Ghibli is one of my favorite films, and I think that it is a
      wonderful example of a modern fairytale. Each of the characters have their
      own agendas; in the end, there aren’t any heroes or villains, they’re just
      people. Each character has some sort of curse or flaw, and the beauty of
      it all is that the viewer sees the physical and emotional transformations
      of each character, and the fairytale as a medium of conveying the story
      works perfectly. Reflecting on my own story, I wanted to build a world
      around this valley, where each of the characters lived in a sort of
      ecosystem and acted off of each other. For instance, I created the
      Magnolia tree as an object of beauty; I must be careful as to how I say
      this, but I wanted to mock how I saw classic fairy tales that Disney
      butchered. For instance, the Willow is incredibly jealous of the Magnolia
      tree, who people admire for its beauty more than the Willow’s beauty.
      People often say ‘weeping willow’ or ‘widowed willow’, and personify the
      willow as an elderly person, while the magnolia flower is associated with
      purity, beauty, and youth. Because of that interpretation, I’m not too
      happy with the symbolic implications of the end of the story, but I think
      the beginning is wonderful. I tried to keep a satirical tone with a
      kafkaesque atmosphere throughout the story. The absurdity of the premise
      of the story, that nostalgic feeling of turning back the clock, of going
      back from Summer to Spring, was a pretty fun concept to explore. All the
      characters all kind of lack any agency; most of the side characters are
      governed by something else, whether they’re a victim of a parasitic heart
      or magical powers which they had no choice over. I do wish that I had more
      time, though. I read a lot of stories in this class, and I recently read
      “The Little Prince” on my own time. I think these stories would have
      inspired me to write my stories differently. I didn’t have to make my
      story all that melancholic; I was just feeling more melancholic when I
      started writing it. Now, I think my story doesn’t quite convey the meaning
      I wanted. I was really disappointed with how I ended it. I wanted the
      ending to be more bittersweet, to express that the world wasn’t
      necessarily better or changed in some way, except that Morgan had
      completed his goal, that the Magnolia bloomed, but it was overshadowed by
      its tragic ending. Nyiesha did an amazing job with her artistic
      interpretations of the story. I am both delighted and humbled to see how
      someone else saw my story. I especially loved how she drew the Willow
      tree. I cannot remember how I got the idea for it, but I wondered what an
      old Willow with a large heart would be like, if it would be wise, or
      generous. But then, how can a willow be wise if it doesn’t even have a
      brain? The brain is the center of thought, the heart is more the center of
      emotion. So, what does a willow tree have to be emotional about? " -

      "My story was inspired by the memories my grandpa would recall to me about
      the United States' invasion of Italy in an attempt to dismantle the Axis
      powers during WW2. His stories are often fragmented, he would sit there on
      the couch and focus for some time on specificities of his memories that I
      thought to be not that important in the greater scheme of the story, which
      I only later came to realize have had a huge impact on his life and the
      way he sees things. Like bubblegum, he could spend hours talking about the
      first time an American troop gave him bubblegum, how strange of a
      substance it was for a child who had never had any, and how good and cool
      it made him feel when he would chew it. He glamorizes these various
      American symbols throughout his stories. I see the facade he puts up in
      order to make sense of his history and it makes me think of all of the
      structures people must build around themselves. structures that are
      impossible to dismantle that we constantly distort in order to function. "

      "Ive always been a fan of fairytales, but I never imagined myself writing
      one. When I think about a fairytales or magical stories I always thought
      that the creators had a level of imagination I just didnt have. Growing up
      as a Disney kid, ive allowed the creators to have the imagination for me
      and never embraced that child like nature as I began to mature . So when I
      was tasked to create my own fairytale I had to push myself out of my
      comfort zone. I came to the conclusion that I needed to write about what I
      know. As a result I've chose to create a fairytale centered around
      personal struggle of mine, following a gifted character name Zarya who
      constantly overextends herself. The protagonist has had a lot of
      obligations from an early age, such as working, taking care of family
      members, keeping the peace, and so on. Zarya and the Ocean of Vision
      covers multiple different themes such as self reflection, family,
      spiritual practices, etc. She reaches a turning point where she has to
      choose between sustaining the peace of others or her own peace. Zarya also
      has a gift of seeing visions gifted to her by the ocean. Being that the
      story is based on myself, writing it was a form of reflection and release
      for me. Because Zarya situation is not exactly my own and less stressful
      it was easy to get into a witing space without me feeling as if im
      spilling my business. On the other hand being able to write and think
      through the mind of the character I was able to place myself outside of
      Zarya, as if I was an outsider looking while still having a conversion
      with my self. It felt like therapy or a very reveiling journaling session.
      Writing this was far from easy. Because this story was coming straight
      from my head it was hard to find a oranizing writing strategy. Outlines
      didnt work because I had to think ahead, and I had no idea where the story
      was going. So I ended up just freewriting when the spirit hit. I am very
      proud of my tale because its not something I would just willingly write.
      I’ve always doubted my sense of imagination, so being able to tap into it
      during this stage of my life may have impacted me more than I know. Being
      able to write a tale base on my experience, cultural background, and
      pratices feels very important right now giving the state of the world. I
      would like to give a hug shout out my family. I have such a dynamic
      relationship with my family. They are very supportive of my journey and
      really believe in me and my dream. My sibilings pushed me to explore my
      spritul nature and are big on upholding spiritual pratice and wellbeing.
      We have a very strong bond and it extends past those in the home with me,
      which I’m very grateful for because many people don't have that support
      system. Although my family is not the real root of my personal conflict,
      they are the ones supporting me through process and ultimately I have to
      make my own choice. Lastly shout out to Professor Harold Ramdass, for
      creating a space for our class to not only learn a rich history of
      storytelling, but allowing us to tell our own storys. What a great class
      to have during the summer. His support, and amazing personality made this
      experience memorable and transforming. " - Nyiesha

      "Part of Brownstone and Cement was with giving a view of gentrification,
      but through a non anthropocentric and varied perspective, provides an
      account of gentrification to those who may not be able to work and last
      towards sustainable protection of their community. To have multiple
      perspectives, while making those voices overtly tangible in the human
      space of communicating, it runs the process of gentrifying a city into
      something humans and creatures alike can’t retaliate against. It becomes
      cosmic, inevitable. Binarizing the city as man and creature/gargoyle in
      contrast to the unnamed yet omnipresent threat references the polarizing
      yet unified subcultures and demographics who banded together under the
      same class struggles. Additionally, because the gargoyles anthropomorphize
      the buildings and architecture they inhabit, or are in proximity too, it
      allows the buildings, which are the longest residents of a city, to also
      have a voice. Because the gargoyle observes, it will communicate through
      narration, not dialogue, and will only be a recipient in communication
      through being a character in space who overhears. Gentrification has
      affected me when I lived in Crown Heights, Newark, and is something that
      is affecting the land ownership in Grenada and Trinidad (where my family
      is from). It has made it harder to trace what community means and the
      relevance of it geographically, and this awareness of the transforming
      landscape has made it harder for me to feel as if I could belong anywhere.
      Working with an artist and editor I feel adds to the theme of the story,
      as a group working together to improve and strengthen it requires
      different skills and capabilities one person can't demonstrate alone. The
      capabilities to look outside in, through different perspectives, is good.
      It means that we can't do anything truly alone, and that's a good thing.
      If I were to do this whole process of making the story again, I would like
      to delce more with the website creation process. Even though it's
      intensive and technical, it was a good opportunity to improve my
      comprehension of basic web programming, even if I didn't directly build
      the design, but in building the interface. Through this project, I've
      gotten more efficient in formatting code, which will allow me to be more
      confident and experimental with new projects and new interests" - Orchid

      "Writing fairytales and creative writing is something I've never done
      before. The girl of the lady allows me to see myself in a new light. Some
      elements and ideas just appeared unconsciously, but when I traced them
      back, they all existed somewhere. The main source of inspiration is a
      comic called Minotaurus's Plate by Fujiko F. Fujio. It tells the story
      about a man who crashes lands on an underdeveloped planet ruled by
      "cow-men" who eat humans, and how he tries to "save" a girl from them. The
      method of switching perspectives and the ironic setting appeal to me. I've
      been thinking about the role of eating and being eaten, but I haven't
      reached a conclusion yet. So I attempted to reflect on the question the
      author has been raising. The story is gradually coming together verbally
      as I walk with my friend. After my first draft, I was suggested to “show
      more” yet had trouble processing it in language. So, as a visual-prone
      person, I made sketches of the room, collected pictures, and then
      described them(sometimes through acting). While revising it, I was
      switching between two languages: telling the story in Chinese and writing
      it in English. It helped me to clarify what I’m going to write. It's a
      pleasure to collaborate with the editor, artist, and clients, with people
      I know and people I don’t know. Throughout the process, we get to know
      each other better, experiencing surprise, passion (along with stress), and
      friendship. If we had more time, I would like to see and make more organic
      elements, decorations, and cute features on the website. For my part, I
      will probably expand the story with dramatic scenarios, more about this
      delicate family, girl's personality, and her mindset. I‘m planning to turn
      the writing into a script and film it this summer. " - Ruiqi

      " I always wanted to create a world that maintained relative complexity in
      its mechanisms and physical laws while also displaying a level of grace
      and beauty. That sounds a bit pretentious, but it was so that events are
      less predictable and the story actually left you feeling some type of way,
      respectively. Fleshing out those elements of complexity and grace are very
      preliminary to the actual details because once a stage of magic is set,
      you can fiddle with it uncountably. However, finding a harmonious median
      for these two was a difficult exercise for someone relatively untrained in
      creative prose. Perhaps it’s cliché, but I chose to make my story revolve
      around the human condition, revealing a prospect of our behavior if an
      element so fundamental to our being is violently stripped from us. The
      tale details a people withdrawn from an impending apocalypse for but a
      blip in hopes that sacrificing form will remedy the illnesses in the human
      condition and revitalize the world. Form becomes a lost luxury that once
      was something everyone simultaneously enjoyed, committed evils on the
      basis of, and served as an inherent aspect to the human experience. I
      wanted the story to encapsulate many aspects synonymous with the human
      experience in all its grace and disgust. A child’s curiosity, will,
      independence, greed, ego, self-destruction, unity… Writing the Harbinger
      of Nothing was a strenuous process which at times rendered me incapable of
      putting more than a sentence down every hour. The root cause of the
      difficulty was also the motivation for writing this fairy tale. I decided
      to play around with the phenomenology, but it got very tricky fast and
      logical reservations followed. Had I given this more time, I would’ve
      worked through the story with less “tell” as I broke style and reverted to
      a more familiar, unbefitting prose because I lacked the command of the
      language to express descriptive scenes poetically. And these breaks in
      style combined with overthinking while proof-reading disturbed the flow
      and ambience building. Some of the creatives who informed and inspired my
      writing: Tetsuya Kinoshita and Yasuko Kobayashi are contributors to Attack
      on Titan, an animated show that is filled with raw emotion, blurs the
      lines between monster and human, pleasure and loss, salvation and
      impotence, etc. I follow many of the logical plot devices in retrospect
      and they inspired the play on phenomenology primarily. Ralph Emerson
      informed the invisibility mechanism in the formless which I often looked
      at for inspiration on how to execute descriptions. Ocean Vuong just writes
      insanely well. " - Simon

    <h3 class="author">© Amanda Blanca</h3>
    <p>
      In the shadow of the mountains lies a small kingdom called Amandi. The
      hustling of the villagers shouting and laughing as they go about their day
      can be heard from miles away. Open-air markets are scattered across the
      town. Near the fountains, you'll find booths with freshly picked fruits
      and vegetables, and tents adorned with hand-crafted home goods. But near
      the castle are rustic wooden stalls adorned with books that recount tales
      of ancient travels, deceitful warlocks, and powerful empresses. The Queen
      was quite the reader and enjoyed old fables of the creatures that live
      beyond her kingdom walls though she dared not step foot outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      The people in Amandi are satisfied and no one feels the need to venture
      beyond their protective limestone walls. Past the mountains is a forest
      completely untouched by human eyes. To the villagers, the forest has no
      name but to the creatures that inhabit it, it's called Tentación. In the
      forest mischievous fairies, abominable ogres and clumsy trolls roam free.
      These creatures are bound to the forest and desire nothing more.
      Meddlesome witches were known for crossing the line and making their
      presence known to the villagers, up until one fateful night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amandi claims to be high functioning and self-sustaining but Monterey
      showed the silly little kingdom how easily it can fall to its knees.
      Monterey was a cunning, evil warlock always up to no good, though you'd
      never know at first glance. He could charm a snake with his voice. He’d
      walk right into the kingdom and no one would question him. He’d go up to
      bakers, groundskeepers, and merchants and just talk. Who would've known
      that such a simple action could cause so much destruction? His
      sweet-talking would set the town back days. He’d distract the workers to
      the point that the kingdom was left without food for a week because of his
      entrancing voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the king caught sight of the one creating so many problems, he
      banished Monterey never to be seen again. Unbeknownst to the king,
      Monterey had a family, a son, who had the king any idea of their
      existence, would’ve been banished, too. The little wizard, like his
      father, was gifted with an innate magnetism, was very approachable, and
      loved to talk. His mother caught sight of that and was concerned about the
      fates of her little wizard son and herself. She feared that he was cursed
      with the same mischievous streak as his father, and so as not to tempt the
      little one into following his father's path, she packed up all their
      things. Finding a new home even deeper in the forest, she was never to see
      or be seen by the neighboring kingdom.
    </p>
    <p>
      His mother cared for him deeply and wanted him to be happy but warned him
      of the dangers that lived outside of their cote in the forest. As he grew
      up, the little wizard became more persistent about leaving the cote. His
      mother was forced to tell him of his father's curse. Though she could not
      know for certain if her son was cursed, she knew it was better to be safe
      than for her son to suffer the same end as his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      She taught him protection spells and how to care for himself in isolation,
      for she knew at her old age she would not get to see him grow. She made
      sure that the little wizard was protected just as long as he stayed near
      the cote.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shortly after she had passed, the little wizard was entirely alone. He
      couldn't have been more than 13, though after a while he lost track.
      Mischief was soon to follow him. Against his mother's tireless efforts to
      keep him safe, each day he would walk a little bit farther out into the
      woods.
    </p>
    <p>
      It wasn't until one evening on his daily walk that his nose caught the
      scent of something different. Now the woods have a very distinct smell of
      musty earth and dried leaves, but today it smelled … good? Filled with
      both excitement and fear he ran to the cote.The smell still lingered but
      he was too afraid to move closer to it and after a few days completely
      forgot about it. Days, weeks, and months go by. The little wizard
      completely forgets about the sweet smell. That is until he smells it
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Near his cote was the biggest tree in the whole forest. He decided to
      climb to the highest branch to get a closer look at what in the world was
      the cause of that heavenly scent. At the top of the tree, he saw it: The
      Kingdom of Amandi was hosting some magnificent festival. It wasn't
      anything like his mother described. There were so many beautiful people!
      People were laughing and singing and the SMELLS! The little wizard almost
      fell from the tree as he leaned in to fill his nose up with as much of
      that sweet smell as possible. His tongue danced with excitement at the
      sight of the fresh berries. The smell of ripe fruit from the open-air
      markets filled the air and traveled through the winding streets circling
      magnificent architecture, and beyond the limestone walls that separate the
      perfectly kept kingdom from the sticky and bug-infested forest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tiled walkways of Amandi led between the zealous flamenco dancers and
      charming guitaristas but the main draw to the town was the Queen. Everyone
      in the kingdom was blowing kisses and throwing flowers at her. The little
      wizard was in awe. He fell asleep at the top of the tree before the
      celebrations could end. He woke up expecting to marvel at the kingdom's
      beauty all over again, but there was nothing. No smells, no flowers,
      nothing. “It can’t be a trick! I saw it, I saw it with my own two eyes!”
      He returned to the topmost branch day after day, hoping for another such
      event, until finally, after a complete cycle of seasons, it returned. And
      it returned at the same time over the next few years. He realized that
      this was a celebration for the Queen that only happens once a year, but
      thankfully, each year. So, every year he made sure to climb up onto his
      tree and get the best view. He yearned to be there celebrating with the
      citizens, but he knew he couldn't.
    </p>
    <p>
      As time passed, the little wizard was little no longer and grew more
      restless. On nights leading up to the festivities, he’d mumble to himself
      in his cote, though no one would pay him any mind mainly because no one
      would go near him. His mother put a protection spell on the cote and the
      land around it so that no creature could stumble onto it. It wasn’t until
      the wizard decided to wander farther from his home, the farthest he'd ever
      gone, that he wept. Nearby was a mischievous fairy collecting berries deep
      in the forest who overheard the wizard’s cry, “Curse my father’s evil ways
      and this wretched curse he bestowed upon me”. Everyone in the forest knew
      about the fate of Monterey and used it as a cautionary tale to avoid the
      kingdom. But no one knew of Monterey’s son. The fairy, growing more
      curious, immediately perked her ears and listened, “I am all alone with no
      family to call my own. I hold no riches to my name. O what’s in a name? I
      wasn’t even graced with one at all! All I ask is for a chance to be seen”.
      The fairy knew exactly what needed to be done, saying: “Hello there odd
      wizard! I couldn’t help but overhear the terrible misfortunes you bear,
      but I believe I can be of some assistance”. Fairies are known for their
      trickery and should never be trusted. The wizard knew that. His mother
      would always warn him of the not-so-kind-hearted creatures of the forest.
      The wizard yelped, “Stay clear, fairy I won't entertain you or your
      trickery!” and fled in the opposite direction before she could say another
      word.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the fairy could tell by the age of the wizard that his curiosity could
      not keep him away. So, she persisted, “But my dear wizard, I know your
      father, dear old Monterey!” she exclaimed. The wizard came to an abrupt
      stop “How do you know my father?”. “Well because you are the spitting
      image of him, of course! Why, anyone would recognize you a mile away.
      Isn’t it a bit dangerous for you to be roaming so close to the kingdom?
      Tread any closer and you'll end up suffering his fate.” With these words,
      the fairy knew she had him. “O you clever thing! I’m begging you, have you
      no charm you can spare me? I want to attend the festival tonight, but I
      fear that one look at me may be my last. Please, I just want to be someone
      else for tonight. Anyone at all, please.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The fairy proposed a wish-me-not spell. As the wizard uttered the spell,
      he became unrecognizable. “Now with this spell, no one will know you to be
      the son of Monterey. You can only use it once a year. You must utter these
      words in front of the kingdom to go in and utter them backward as you
      depart. But, I must warn you….” but the wizard stopped her mid-sentence:
      “Yes! I’ll take it there’s no use wasting time with cautionary tales; just
      give me the spell”. The thing about fairies is that they prey on honest
      and innocent souls. Especially desperate souls. And desperate souls will
      take anything, even without hearing the consequences of their gifts.
      Knowing that it would be far more fun to watch the wizard proceed without
      her proper warning, she gave him the tiny scroll with the spell and
      returned from whence she came.

    />
    <p>
      The wizard ran straight towards the kingdom without looking back. He knew
      he was going in the right direction because the mouth-watering smell of
      fresh fruits would not lead his nose astray. Before him was the limestone
      gate, which looked much bigger from the top of his tree. He recited the
      fairy’s spell, closed his eyes, and walked right in.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the wizard could think about was how happy the citizens of Amandi
      looked when he was spying upon them from his tree. Even though he was so
      far away then, he could sense the energy created by the people's festive
      joy during this time of the year. And when he opened his eyes, it could
      not have been more true. Flowers covered the streets and adorned the
      ancient buildings in bursts of colors at every crossroad and junction. He
      tried to stay clear of the people, but just could not help himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wizard bumped into a man taking care of some cattle near the limestone
      walls. He heard him talking to his cattle about “the big day” and how
      everything “must go perfectly.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Excuse me, my good sir!” exclaimed the wizard, “I couldn’t help but
      overhear you talking about a big day. What day is it today?”.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man let out a hardy laugh, “Well, my boy, it's the Queen's big day!”
      “Ah yes of course and so what usually happens on days like this?” asked
      the wizard. “Well today the whole kingdom gathers and makes sure the day
      runs smoothly for the Queen’s big day, many people bake and brew the most
      delicious food and others just make sure the kingdom is spotless.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so the wizard, intrigued by the sight of so many four-legged
      creatures, asked, “What are you doing for the big day today, sir?”
    </p>
    <p>
      The man laughed, saying, “Well, I’ll be selling these cows to the Queen.
      Hopefully, she’ll see how nice and plump they are and want to buy them.
      I’m sure they'll make a mighty fine dinner!”
    </p>
    <p>
      The wizard, fully perplexed by this sentiment, convinces the man to set
      the cattle free at least for a few hours before they are sent to be
      slaughtered, “It's a beautiful day out and the festivities seem like a lot
      of fun, don’t you think?!”
    </p>
    <p>
      The man, without missing a beat, responded, “Well sure, it is a beautiful
      day, and the Queen isn't due to come out until later tonight. Surely,
      she'll see no harm in her animals roaming around before they hit the
      slaughter. Thanks, kid!”
    </p>
    <p>
      The wizard was pleased, he saved the cattle from being tonight's dinner
      and that silly man believed he was doing a great service to his Queen.
      Win-win situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he stumbled upon a woman selling the most delicious crepes made fresh
      on her small cart in the middle of a busy street. That must be where the
      smell was coming from. He moved past the huge crowd surrounding the cart
      and cried out, “Hello, fair maiden!” to the women running the stand.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why hello, young man. What can I do for you today?” The lady had fully
      forgotten about the massive line in front of her and devoted her attention
      to the wizard.
    </p>
    <p>
      “These pastries smell divine! They smell so good, I bet the ogres and
      trolls could smell them from the forest!” She gave him a small chuckle and
      said that the recipe had been in her family for years. He was in awe, but
      saw how much she was struggling and wanted to lend a hand. Without
      hesitating, he took her bowl and mixing spoon and added all the
      sweet-smelling ingredients she had around her and mixed them all up. The
      wizard, so proud of his concoction, said “Here you go, miss. I’ve mixed a
      large bowl of sweetness so that you may cook up a quick batch and serve
      these hungry people. Thank you for your services!” And with that, he
      snatched a pastry from her stand and left.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he made his way deeper into the kingdom more people were talking
      excitedly about the “big day”. Still not entirely sure what he was meant
      to do and wanting to be of help, he listened in.
    </p>
    <p>
      “There's something wrong with the pipes again! You don't say! We fixed
      them up yesterday. What could be causing this leak?”.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wizard popped in and decided to give the pipes a look. “Hello gentle
      townsmen. It seems that you are in need of some help, no?”
    </p>
    <p>
      The townsmen perked up their ears, delighted to see the wizard. “Thank
      you, my boy. Yes, indeed we are,” replied one. They felt comfortable in
      the wizard's presence. Indeed, everyone he had spoken to had found it easy
      speaking to him of their problems. He felt so content that these men were
      giving him the time of day, so he asked, “Why don't you all take a rest
      and I can handle the leaky pipes. Don’t you worry!”
    </p>
    <p>
      The men cheered, “Thanks, young chap! We really ought to be getting ready
      for the celebration!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, yes, the celebration! When does it start again?” asked the wizard.
      “Well as soon as the Queen quits her chambers; it shouldn’t be long now!”.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wonderful,” the wizard thought. He would finally be able to meet the
      Queen and learn what the celebration was all about. And as the men walked
      away to prepare for the festival, the young wizard too gets up and
      departs, forgetting his promise to resolve the problem at hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sees the castle right up ahead guarded by men too many to count. He
      knew he must see her before she presented herself to her kingdom. He
      deemed it fitting to do so since he was a newcomer to these wonderful
      events and he wanted to ensure their proper introduction. He waved at the
      guards as he approached the door and they all smiled back and moved aside
      to let him right in. One man even escorts him straight to her chambers.
      This whole time, he could think only of how wrong his mother was for
      thinking the kingdom was evil. They had been nothing but gracious to him.
      As he opened the door to the Queen's chambers, he found her pacing the
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I cannot believe this! Everything that could go wrong, is! How could this
      be? It could have been any day, but not this one. Insufferable!”
    </p>
    <p>
      The Queen was practically ripping out her luxuriously coiffed tresses, yet
      the wizard could only think about how breathtaking the Queen looked. He
      could not avert his gaze. She was the image of beauty and no fairy or elf
      could compare.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Greetings…my Queen?” he managed to stutter. “How may I serve you? he
      asked inquisitively. At those words, she let her guard down almost
      immediately, “Well, if you must know, everything is going wrong today.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The wizard offers his services, “C-c-c-can I help in any w-” but she
      immediately cuts him off. ”My cattle are roaming the kingdom and fouling
      the city streets instead of being prepped for dinner. The pastries taste
      more delicious than ever, but they are making my people sick! And to top
      it all off, the main sewage pipe just burst and the stench is seeping into
      every crevice in this kingdom and weakening the limestone walls of my
      city! I have no idea what could cause this much chaos and destruction. Can
      you believe this is all happening on my birthday?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Though the wizard was concerned by all the mayhem of which the Queen was
      complaining, he couldn't help but utter, “I’m sorry, my Queen, but what is
      a birthday?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Her face lit with amusement as if that question dissolved all her
      problems: “Do you…Do you not know what a birthday is, my noble subject?”.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wizard giggled at the Queen calling him, “her noble subject” and said:
      “No, my Queen, I’m not from these parts. Please tell me more about
      birthday”. So the Queen did and so much more. Any little curiosities the
      wizard had about her kingdom and her people he would ask and she would
      answer with utmost amusement. Time passed and before they knew it, it was
      nightfall.
    </p>
    <p>
      After many hours without hearing from his daughter, the King went into her
      chamber to find her talking to a curious-looking little man. “Dearest, do
      you not see what has become of your realm? The infrastructure of this
      great kingdom, your kingdom, is crumbling and you are nowhere to be seen!
      Who is to blame for this?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “O father, I’m so sorry! All my time has been taken up by this young
      fellow. His name is….Oh, pardon my manners, but I haven’t gotten your
      name.” The wizard lay frozen in his tracks.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king was looking straight through him and he knew everything. As he
      shouts,“GUARDS!” the wizard bolts out of the Queen's chambers past the
      startled faces of the king and company and heads for the gates.
    </p>
    <p>
      The King sensed something familiar in the strange goings-on in the
      kingdom. Monterey had a son. He thought that by keeping his daughter
      within the confines of the kingdom, she’d be safe, but he was wrong. The
      king had had enough of old Monterey in his time and he would not stand to
      be fooled by his son now.
    </p>
    <p>
      The King had his men chase him out of the kingdom and just as he reached
      the gates of her domain, he turned and recited the spell backward as the
      fairy instructed him, hiding behind a bush and fearing the worst. To his
      astonishment, he witnesses the unthinkable. As the Queen's men grow
      nearer, they jolt back abruptly and look at each other in great confusion.
      “What are we doing at the edge of the gate?” exclaims one man.
    </p>
    <p>Another joins with, “Did we leave the gate open?”</p>
    <p>
      “The Queen is going to be so mad if she learns of the gates being open,
      especially on her birthday! Quick, quick! Close it and head back to the
      party.” The men shut the gates and go back as planned. Everyone’s memory
      of that night faded fast. The subjects were all perplexed, but too scared
      to speak up about their lapse in memory. So, they just pretended nothing
      happened and continued to laugh, sing, and dance as if nothing strange had
      occurred.
    </p>
    <p>
      “D-d-did they really just forget?” questioned the wizard. He noticed that
      as he completed uttering the spell backward, the whole kingdom forgot all
      about his little visit. Right then and there, he hit upon a plan for an
      annual visit. He, unlike Monterey, would have many second chances. And
      though his appearance changed countless times when he was in the kingdom,
      the same misfortunes followed him, just as they had his father. Yes, he
      felt terrible that he caused problem upon problem but throughout those
      nights his magic made him feel more alive than ever. He vowed every
      “birthday” to come to the Queen's party and keep her in sweet conversation
      in her chambers a little longer. And, he knew exactly what to do when her
      father would inevitably spoil the moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before heading back into the forest he noticed the gates swung open and
      the guards were throwing out large bins of waxy wheels and wedges in
      various sizes and colors. They mumbled something about these precious
      goods being banned from the kingdom. One of the wheels rolled in front of
      the wizard's feet. As he read the beautiful hand lettering that spelled
      “MANCHEGO”, he snickered: “What’s in a name, indeed?”

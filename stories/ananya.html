    <h2 class="story-title">The Curse of Chambal</h2>
    <h3 class="author">© Ananya Malagi</h3>
    <p>
      In the Old Land of Kings, along the Chambal river, a town became busy with
      travelers and traders after Independence from the Angresi Invaders had
      swept the nation into celebration and chaos. The town, though small, had
      been favored by the Angresi because of its proximity to the river, much
      like the princes of the kingdoms before. Angresi upstart architecture vied
      with the splendid palaces of the old Ranas, making the town a place of
      romance and wonder. Gardens, shops, shiny cars, streets dotted with
      vendors, and mosaics of blue and red, all seemed overcast in the
      uncertainty of the town’s future.
    </p>
    <p>
      The monsoon was upon them, and In the outskirts of the town, in a small
      house surrounded by towering guava trees, lived a man who appeared to be
      of thirty years or so. He spent his days somberly, for he was the carrier
      of a particular and insidious condition.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had lived as he was for over a hundred years now. The passing of each
      season meant nothing to him, except that each summer he could stand to
      face the sun less and less. . He had seen the town grow and change over
      generations of funerals - sometimes as a distant uncle, or a quiet clerk,
      or an inconspicuous delivery man.
    </p>

    <p>
      He had forgotten the look of his own face. His hair dark and long, and he
      would bring his hands up to touch his skin. He imagined his eyes glinting
      gold and red, his long cheeks like a hound, his nose like the snout of a
      bat.
    </p>
    <p>
      To become a different person every year, in hopes to remain unseen for
      what he was, he visited a tailor in town to find a new suit to travel the
      quiet nights with. The tailor and his family were reliable, discreet. A
      strange sickness had overtaken the town, and with so many traveling in and
      out of it, he was determined to stay with what he trusted.
    </p>
    <p>
      When entered the store, he saw the mother of the family at her station,
      and another woman at the large table in front. He ordered a suit of dark
      hand-embroidered cotton. As he began to collect himself to leave, the new
      woman frowned and interjected, “I remember you.”
    </p>
    <p>He frowned as well.</p>
    <p>“I remember you from a long time ago, you have come here before.”</p>
    <p>
      He looked at her, a young woman who was confident as she stood there. As
      he looked into her downturned eyes, he remembered the daughter of the
      family as a teen, still fumbling with threads and needles that tangled
      around her as she worked.
    </p>
    <p>“You have a funny way about you,” she said lightly, and he smiled.</p>
    <p>
      Her name was Svaha, and she began to recognize him in the streets as he
      did his daily errands at dusk, and the two became quickly familiar with
      each other. When Svaha took her breaks from working at the shop, she would
      walk to the nearby step well - one of the only peaceful places in town in
      the evening. She could spend hours looking at each intricate flower carved
      into the criss-crossing stone around her, and would throw small pebbles
      across the water to hear their echo. She wondered how many thousands of
      years had passed in this well, and imagined herself as someone else in the
      past, and what it would be like if she had been born in another time.
    </p>
    <p>
      They saw each other one evening as Svaha sat on the edge of the step well,
      under a waning moon. They spoke about the townspeople, the funny secrets
      they knew about each person, and how her family was preparing for changes
      in the town’s government.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Chota Bhai is worried that we will send him to military school. But I
      said, we would never do that! He’s not even strong enough to carry the
      bolts of fabric. He’s good at wearing them though. He’ll make a much
      better tailor than me!”
    </p>
    <p>
      Time passed, and in the blue light Svaha noticed how shiny his skin was,
      and then how cold his hand was. She did not see that in the water below
      her, her reflection rippled alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      One night, Svaha ran through the road wailing and crying. She was a
      banshee in the dark - her father had passed away. He had been struck by
      the sickness, but they hoped, by some miracle, that he would eventually
      recover.
    </p>
    <p>“What’s happened?” he ran up to her and asked.</p>
    <p>
      “My father is dead, his cough took him away. And my mother is going to be
      laid down on the pyre with him! They say that she doesn’t want to be here,
      not without him, and I keep pleading, and they won’t listen, and I will
      stop them, I don’t know what to do!”
    </p>
    <p>
      Torn with the idea of losing two people at once, of being an orphan
      grieving forever, she cried in his arms.
    </p>
    <p>In that moment, he knew what he had to ask her.</p>
    <p>“If I knew a way to save her, would you let me tell you?”</p>
    <p>
      With wide eyes she listened as he told her about a trick–rather a
      prayer–where she could remain unscathed under the fire. And that if she
      were quick, she could hide her mother and take her place.
    </p>
    <p>
      He then explained the way he had lived all these years, how his body had
      changed, and how she could choose to save her mother’s life if she wanted
      to.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without question, Svaha repeated the prayer and ran home. That night she
      tossed and turned with a strange fever. At dawn, she dropped a small vial
      of datura essence upon her sleeping mother’s lips, quietly pulling the
      door lock shut. She disguised herself in the white funereal shroud, a
      white scarf veiled around her head; and she sat on the edge of her
      mother’s bed in this disguise, waiting to be collected by the priest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Together they walked down toward the edge of the river, and in the mist
      she could see her aunts and cousins knee deep in water, surrounding the
      small boat where her father lay on the pyre. The bank of the river had
      transformed - hundreds of orange, red and, white flowers sat at the top of
      the gray water, incense smoke and the droning of prayers clouded the air,
      with the noise of metal pots and crackling lamps.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was laid down next to him - both of them swaddled like ghosts, one
      dead and one alive. She noticed how she could not hear her own heartbeat,
      and Slowly the boat was pushed into the current, flames rising up around
      her. Her skin remained cold, like a stone; the fire couldn't touch her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boat started to break apart, and she dropped down into the water,
      swimming underneath to stay hidden. The river was murky - she had never
      swam so deep before, and she could see all the things that had sunk to the
      river floor over time. Gold jewelry and coins, bicycle wheels and extra
      car parts. The horn of a phonograph, broken glass picture frames, and bits
      of roof from the riverside huts. There was enough down there to make a
      whole new town, she thought, and wondered if the bottom of the step well
      held a secret world like this beneath. As she approached the shallow end
      of the river, a small scarf became trapped around her ankle. It was black
      and embroidered, identical to the pattern she had cut for the man at the
      tailoring shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gasping for air, and far away at the other bank, she wrung the water from
      her dress. She waited for sunset, when the townsfolk turned indoors, to
      make her way home. There, she found her mother safely waking out of her
      deep sleep.
    </p>
    <p>“Listen to me, we have to leave this place.”</p>
    <p>
      “I don’t understand what is happening,” her mother said, “They will be
      expecting me soon.”
    </p>
    <p>“No they won’t. Everything will be alright.”</p>
    <p>
      Her mother was a statue, silent and willing. They walked to the house
      hidden among the guava trees to find a welcome refuge.
    </p>
    <p>
      <center>********</center>
    </p>
    <p>
      A few months passed. Shaken by the chaos, and tired of having to disguise
      herself to leave the house, Svaha’s mother decided to go live with her
      cousin in another district.
    </p>
    <p>
      Svaha continued to live there with the cursed man. One year passed, two
      years passed, and she grew stronger in her new way of being. She found
      that she could lift bags of rice much easier and go days without feeling
      hungry.
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening Svaha entered the parlor, and saw him crumpled on the floor in
      front of his reading chair. She noticed how much the wrinkles in his face
      drooped, his hair shedding on the marble floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook him, softly at first, then more and more frantically, “Are you
      alright!”
    </p>
    <p>
      His eyes opened, slowly. With a slight grimace, “Don’t worry about me. I
      am fine.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But look at your face, your skin, your hair. I know you are struggling. I
      don’t understand….”
    </p>
    <p>He sat down and looked at her with an empty gaze.</p>
    <p>
      “That day, I told you about my curse and you saved your mother. I did not
      tell you that the prayer itself was the curse. When you made the choice to
      take her place, and the fire didn’t hurt you, I passed the curse to you. I
      am finally free of it.”
    </p>

    <p>
      He did not tell her that he trusted her family, and helped them so,
      because she was his great-granddaughter of five generations, and her
      mother the fourth. He had stayed here on the outskirts of the town so long
      only to see his descendants change, grow, and prosper while he was frozen
      in what he was. It was the only way he could bear to live so long.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You tricked me!” She was shocked. “You did not want to help us! You
      wanted to use me! You are a monster.” Flustered and angry, she ran down
      the stairs and out of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Into the forest she ran and ran and ran, the red dirt on her bare feet.
      The sun set over the tall canopy. And as she ran through the night, her
      dress tearing on the undergrowth, she felt her legs become nimble like a
      fox, her hair grow coarse like a boar, her eyes begin to shine yellow like
      a snake.

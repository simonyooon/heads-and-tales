        <p>
          Close to the stretch of mountains resided the town of Solie, whose
          irrigation system would snake across the land to the different bodies
          of water nearby. Emm took a liking to this puzzle and quickly became
          one of the few trusted with perfecting their water management system
          over the years. While the people of the town lived a quiet and
          reserved life, the extravagant designs of the canals, which could be
          observed from the top of the mountain, spoke loudly and unmistakably.
          Emm took pride in the spectacle, though that was merely a byproduct of
          her efforts. She made the usual routine of traversing the countryside
          and observing the different bodies of water that they had close
          proximity to. One lake in particular, she would always pass by
          thinking nothing of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unknown to Emm or anyone else, occasionally on any given morning just
          before sunrise, a family of Ladybugs would descend and surround the
          perimeter of the lake taking in all that it had to offer. They had
          recently woken up from a century long hibernation right around the
          time Emm began exploring the land they would wander. Securing the
          water’s edge, they would stay long enough to take in its minerals, but
          not so long as to be revealed by the sun, for being revealed in this
          grand manner to other creatures could prove to be devastating. On this
          particular morning, they gathered but were in no rush to leave as the
          great rainfall of the previous day had reinvigorated the lake’s
          offerings and the clouds offered a protective blanket.
        </p>
        <p>
          Journeying through the land, Emm came on the lake and attributed the
          buzzing chatter to nothing more than nature's song. There wasn't a
          single rustle of leaves, nor a distant bird call, but a glow around
          the lake. Almost completely overlooking it at first, Emm was stunned
          when she glanced over again and saw the tribe of ladybugs hovering and
          swaying as one. Getting closer, the buzzing grew louder, but before
          they could meet this interloper, she retreated. She ran to her friends
          and family with excitement in hopes of introducing them to this
          spectacle. Returning to the same lake though, they found dragonflies
          and gnats and looked at Emm with annoyance instead of joy. Where Emm
          boasted of bright red spots that adorned the lake, they saw silt. The
          ladybugs had long left as one and left only the sounds of wind and
          trees.
        </p>
        <p>
          And so passed on the months and years where they would come before
          sunrise to the lake and Emm would return in search of them. They began
          to linger around the lake for longer than the morn and becoming
          accustomed to the presence of other land creatures they seemed to know
          exactly when they weren't being sought. They sensed when they were
          being called for and when they were being ignored, scurrying when
          being searched for but content with being unsuspectingly greeted.
          These moments of surprise were when their chatter was most high. And
          watching Emm pass around the lake on one particular day as she paid no
          mind, they began to tempt her with their song. The unison was
          familiar. And taken aback by their reappearance, Emm approached them,
          but this time in hopes of bringing some back as proof. But as she
          reached further, their soothing buzz turned sour. Cupping a mound of
          them in her palms, Emm ran with joy to reveal her palms but showed
          nothing. Empty handed and embarrassed, Emm didn't disclose what she
          was carrying to the others. The lake saw her steps return shortly
          after, but now without the ladybugs to spectate.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thinking that what the ladybugs wanted was a formal welcome, Emm began
          developing a plan to give them a direct route to the town by
          connecting the lake with a path that would wind all the way through
          the land and join the existing irrigation system. Though many in the
          town remained skeptical and warned her of the dangers that connecting
          a new water source could create, she continued on with her efforts in
          search of the group of ladybugs. Emm poured her days and nights into
          this addition, hopeful of what would come. Once finished, the new
          addition intertwined with their system well.
        </p>
        <p>
          The usual quiet of one night was broken by distant thunder that
          steadily grew closer, louder, and more ominous. The ladybugs came to
          the lake early but were unusually rigid in their movements. The clouds
          announced a storm, which was not out of the norm. But as the rains
          pelted down, the water system began to flood. The link to the lake
          brought in far more water than the system was originally designed to
          contain. The trees swayed like never before and within an instant
          everyone was looking around for help. They searched for Emm knowing
          that she must know what to do. Emm had never seen such quick flooding.
          Out of worry, she made her way with great difficulty to the lake where
          she saw the water rushing out and the last of the ladybugs scrambling
          to safety. Overwhelmed with the chaos, there was nothing more to do
          than to wait it out. The responsibility fell to Emm but no one cared
          to hear why she wanted to link the lake, or give any thought to
          ladybugs during such a torrent. The flooding damaged many homes and
          she was regarded differently by the people who had once marveled at
          her work.
        </p>
        <p>
          Emm grew lonesome and felt betrayed by the ladybugs. She stopped
          trying to convince others that they existed and wanted nothing to do
          with them.In truth, there was an emptiness in Emm for failing to
          engage them but she knew of no other way to channel her emotions
          outside of anger and resentment. She worked at tearing down the
          causeway she had created and lost any reason to pass the lake.
        </p>
        <p>
          Though Emm put little thought into the ladybugs, they thought
          differently. One morning when Emm found herself traveling through the
          land she heard an old hum and she reluctantly followed the sound that
          led her back to the lake. They surrounded the lake as usual and Emm,
          being unsure of how to receive their reappearance, just sat there with
          them. She tried to just be in their presence, and let go of her plans
          for the day. The ladybugs alighted on the lake briefly, arranging
          themselves in a beautifully intricate pattern on the surface of the
          lake that reflected the canals. But they also created formations and
          designs from places unfamiliar to Emm. .
        </p>
        <p>
          Emm couldn't help but smile and enjoy the rest of her time with them.
          She was content with them now; more, she was content to know that they
          existed and shared her love of water. She learned to put her tasks on
          hold and save time for the ladybugs who were happy to see her. She
          felt guided by the patterns she saw in how they traced on the lake’s
          surface. When questioned as to why she began spending more time out
          and about she would just smirk and say that she just wanted to enjoy
          the buzz of the land.

        <p>
          From a young age, Zarya had a special connection to water, for she was
          born in the water of the island Tyrin. She always felt drawn to the
          ocean. It would call out to her at night. In her dreams, the ocean
          would reveal itself to her and provide a cool and calming comfort as
          if she were floating in it. She spent many nights with the ocean in
          her dreams until she was of age to visit it on her own.
        </p>
        <p>
          The middle child of five, Zarya loved her siblings and had a unique
          relationship with each one. They all entrusted her with their deepest
          and darkest secrets, for she had an openness about her and gave sound
          advice on struggles they had with friends or decisions they were
          struggling to make. Every morning before dawn, she would walk out to
          the water and lose track of time singing to it. She had a gift, you
          see: as she let out a melodic tune, the ocean revealed visions to her,
          none of which related to her own path. After serenading the ocean with
          her soft tune, the water began to glow and spiral. A vision would
          appear of a choice being made. It was a beautiful sight, but she could
          only see the paths of others on the island. She indeed had a powerful
          gift, and she made certain not to abuse her knowledge of the things
          she saw. The ocean warned to never share her visions with others. She
          must only encourage others to choose their right path and allow them
          to make such decisions on their own.
        </p>
        <p>
          After spending her early morning with the ocean, she would return back
          home and begin her day. Zarya kept a strict routine. She would start
          by refreshing her ancestors' altar by providing them with a meal, a
          cup of bush tea and placing a fresh bowl of water from the ocean in
          the center. In the back grew an assortment of herbs such as soursop,
          bay leaf and mint. She made sure to cut a piece of the lemongrass for
          her Nana, who was her favorite. She’d then began making breakfast for
          the family. She always served her Nana first then her younger
          siblings. Her family didn’t always share a meal in the morning but
          they always gathered for dinner. She passed most mornings caring for
          her younger siblings Arin and Calab before school, while listening to
          stories her Nana would share about her adventures or memories from her
          childhood long ago
        </p>
        <p>
          Her family was known for building the best boats on the island. They
          crafted the finest boats made from the trunks of the magical Palms
          that grew in the grove close to their house. The palms had been
          nurtured by her family for generations. As the family continued to
          maintain the ancestral altar and praise those who transcended, the
          ancestors would continue to bless the palm grove. Zarya took on many
          responsibilities. She wasn't old enough to work at the shop, for she
          was only 14, but that didn't stop her from helping to design and build
          boats.
        </p>
        <p>
          At school, Zarya's favorite subject was geography, she had never been
          off the island before, so it allowed her to see the world beyond the
          ocean surrounding her. After finishing homework with friends, she
          would make her way to her family's shop to help in any way she could.
          She enjoyed being able to build something as magnificent as a boat. At
          times she found herself sitting upon the dock creating designs. As she
          looked upon the water, the fish would swim in the most beautiful
          patterns that inspired her sketches.
        </p>
        <p>
          As she grew, so did her relationship with the ocean. It brought her
          objects from far away lands that only stoked her curiosity for the
          worlds from which they came. During one morning serenade, a coin
          washed upon the shore. When she took it back to show Nana, she
          recognized where it could have come from. She had a coin just like it
          from her travels in Ghana. It was a special trip for her as she was
          tracing the family’s origins. Her Nana Ellis was a well traveled
          woman, as she had left the island after being given the opportunity to
          follow her dream of being a travel writer. At that time Nana Ellishad
          already given birth to Zarya’s mother Aya and younger brother Aydan .
          A childhood friend approached her with the opportunity to join him in
          exploration and document their findings that she couldn’t pass up.
          Nana’s older sister promised to care for her children as her own. She
          had never left the island before and it was even harder to leave her
          children.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nana wrote amazing stories about her travels and had a collection of
          journals dating back to the age of 13. She made sure to write detailed
          letters to the children when she could, occasionally sending a
          picture. As her mother and her brother began to question more and more
          when their mother would return, Nana Ellis could give no answer. The
          last place Nana visited was Ghana, after receiving a letter from Tyrin
          that Aydan fell ill and that she needed to come back as soon as
          possible. When she returned, after ten years, Aydan was growing sicker
          by the day and they began to believe his end was near. Upon her
          return, Nana raised the altar and adorned it with treasures from Ghana
          to ask that the powers and ancestors protect her son’s health. She
          then immediately brewed a thick bush tea made of herbs collected from
          her travels. Days of drinking his mother’s tea made Aydan stronger and
          safe from harm
        </p>
        <p>
          It didn't take Nana long to settle back on the island. She became
          popular because few people left, and most of them never returned. She
          was also very beautiful, her hair was long and thick and she had the
          most beautiful smile. She gave birth to 2 more children after her
          return. Everyone was happy she was back, except for Zarya’s mother.
          She resented her for leaving her at such a young age. Neither time nor
          everyone’s talking about Nana’s travels diminished these feelings..
        </p>
        <p>
          When Zarya turned 17, she graduated top of her class. She needed to
          figure out what was next for her. She worked in the shop helping her
          father and older sibling make boats. She would add the finishing touch
          by painting her beautiful designs on the side. Everyday she followed
          the same routine, which became mundane. Though her younger siblings
          now joined her in preserving the altar, which made their relationship
          stronger, she wanted more from life.
        </p>
        <p>
          One early morning during her ritual, she noticed a wave in the
          distance. As she watched, it swelled larger and faster, causing her to
          back away from the water’s edge. . In disbelief, she did not run,
          because such waves never formed in their tranquil bay. The wave came
          to an immediate stop at her toes and all the water held in place as if
          suspended. The surface and depths glowed as far as she could see,
          summoning an unusual vision of a distant place. In the water, she saw
          her mother yelling at Nana, “Is you! You is why she leaving we! ”
          Later that night, she dreamed the waters telling her to make a choice,
          to stay on the island or leave. But the choice had to be hers alone.
          If she chose to venture out, it would protect and guide her through
          her journey. At first she felt confused. She always wanted to leave,
          but she knew the consequences too well. This time she didn't share the
          vision or dream with her Nana, hoping it wouldn't come true.
        </p>
        <p>
          Months went by with Zarya giving little thought to the vision from the
          ocean. Nana grew ill, a little worse every day, so she spent every
          moment possible with her. She began making fewer trips to the ocean.
          Sensing her final days approach, Zarya asked Nana every question she
          could think of. One day, she finally had the courage to ask her, “Were
          you happy when you came back home?”
        </p>
        <p>
          Nana replied “ Yes, when I did see how big your moder and uncle did
          grow, all de pain I felt when I left come rushing back. And your moder
          never trust me again. Is that made me realize I had to stay. But I was
          never as happy as I was when in the world”.
        </p>
        <p>
          On her 18th birthday, Nana gave her all the books, journals and
          stories she ever wrote about her travels, but there was one book
          individually wrapped. It was about her time in Ghana. As Zarya
          unwrapped and leafed through it, she saw that it was incomplete. She
          did not stop reading until she completed it. It reminded her of the
          ultimatum the ocean gave her. But she didn't believe she was ready as
          she had no real reason to leave the island and no plan. There were so
          many questions, but no one to ask. Three days later Nana passed away
          and was buried on the family’s land, near the palm trees. It was a
          dark and cold morning that day, and Zarya took it the hardest,
          spending most of the day crying by the ocean. The ocean provided her
          comfort the way it used to when she was a child. After giving her some
          time to grieve, the ocean once more revealed the vision of an unknown
          place . Not thinking it was a good time to leave, but wanting to more
          than ever, cried at the altar to the ancestors for advice the next
          morning, she placed a cup of lemon grass tea.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her mother awoke, hearing the latch on the door open. At first
          alarmed, waves of recognition washed over her. She thought to herself,
          “Well, she always felt more like her daughter than mine.” Laying on
          her side, she closed eyes tightly to keep the salt tears from
          spilling.
